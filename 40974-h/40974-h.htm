	<h2>
		PREFACE.
		</h2>

	<p class="salut">
		<span class="smcap">Gentle Reader</span>,
	</p>

	<p>
		An Author who is only making a <i xml:lang="fr">début</i>, should be particularly
		careful not to offend against established rules; otherwise you and
		I might be spared the plague of a Preface; but as I am heartily
		desirous to conciliate your regard, I will not forfeit any portion
		of your esteem at my onset, by the slightest contempt of Court.
		I will therefore say a few words in the way of introduction to
		Blue-stocking Hall, though I may find it difficult to tell you more
		than you will easily find out for yourself, if you take the trouble
		of reading the following Letters, which sufficiently explain
		their own story. They are selected from a correspondence which is
		supposed to have been spread over a period of four years.
	</p>

	<p>
		As to my motives (for I observe that most
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
												  prefaces talk of
		<em>motives</em>) for publishing the letters which I have been at the
		pains to collect, they are such as we may in charity suppose
		to operate upon the mind of a criminal, when by the expiatory
		tribute of his "last speech and dying words," he endeavours, in
		a recantation of his own errors, to prevent others from falling
		into similar ones. Besides, we are generally eager to make as many
		proselytes as we can to any opinion which we have newly adopted;
		and as my prejudices upon some subjects were very strong before I
		visited Blue-stocking Hall, I am induced, through abundance of the
		milk of human kindness, to wish that if my reader entertains any
		prejudices against ladies stigmatized as <i xml:lang="fr">Bas Bleus</i>, as I myself
		once did, he may, like me, become a convert to another and a fairer
		belief respecting them.

	<h3>
		LETTER I.<br />
		<span class="smcap">Charles Falkland to Arthur Howard.</span>
	</h3>

	<p class="salut">
		My Dear Howard,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		Dover.
	</p>

	<p>
		Perhaps you and I are at this moment similarly situated, and
		similarly employed. I am seated at a window which opens on the
		sea, waiting for a summons to the steam-packet which is to waft me
		over to Calais&mdash;while you are, probably, expecting that which is
		to convey you to Ireland. When I reach France I shall certainly
		send you a bill of health from time to time; but as few things are
		less satisfactory than letters <em>from the road</em>, I shall reserve
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
		my share in the performance of our parting covenant till I am quietly
		settled at Geneva.
	</p>

	<p>
		You do not require descriptions of either places or people; because
		innumerable diaries, journals, and sketch-books, tell you as much
		as you want to know of all the scenes which it is your intention
		ere long to visit; and as to men and women, no second-hand account
		can supply the place of actual acquaintance with the few of
		either sex that deserve to occupy thoughts or pen. What you <em>do</em>
		desire, and what I have engaged to furnish, is a history of my own
		employments, pursuits, and impressions; but leisure is necessary
		for collecting and arranging; and, till I can satisfy myself by
		sending you such details as I hope may <em>interest</em>, you must be
		content to receive only certificates of whole bones.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now <em>you</em> are to be set down quietly in less than a week at the end
		of your journey; and before I set sail I shall take the liberty of
		repeating the terms of our epistolary contract, by way of flapper
		to your memory, and leaving you no possible excuse for violating
		the treaty
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
				   ratified at Cambridge on Monday evening, ere a mutual
		<em>Vale</em> dismissed us on our several adventures.
	</p>

	<p>
		You see that I have <em>first</em> registered my own part in our
		engagement, and generously bound myself, before I proceed to tie
		you down.&mdash;Now for <em>your</em> undertaking. Remember, that when you
		reach the wilds of Kerry, you are under a heavy bond to devote a
		part of every day regularly to the task which I have assigned you
		of narrating, in minute detail, every circumstance connected with
		the external situation, personal appearance, mind, manners, and
		habits of your aunt and her family. Aye, there I see you at this
		instant in a full roar of laughter: so be it.&mdash;I am case-hardened;
		and have so long endured your merriment with becoming philosophy,
		that I am not to be subdued by a little louder ridicule than you
		are accustomed to level at my <em>romance</em>. Well, I will confess (now
		that I am a few miles distant from that taunting smile), that my
		notions are somewhat odd, quaint, old fashioned, or romantic if
		you will; and in return for this concession, I only ask
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
																that you
		will bear with me, and indulge your friend's peculiarities, as they
		are at least harmlessly eccentric. The bias of my mind is to be
		traced without difficulty to the circumstances of my early life,
		so different from your own, that it would be very extraordinary if
		much dissimilarity were not discoverable in our ways of thinking.
		My boyish years were passed in the seclusion of almost perfect
		solitude, with a mother, whose image lives indelibly engraven on
		my heart. A child of feeble frame, I was unable in early life to
		bear the "peltings of the pitiless storm," and from every wind that
		would have visited my infant form too roughly, did the tenderest
		of maternal affections shroud, without enervating, my childhood.
		My widowed mother was every thing to me&mdash;my friend, my tutor, my
		protectress, my play-fellow&mdash;my all on earth. In losing her at
		sixteen, I was left a mere wreck upon the ocean of life; and, while
		"Memory holds her seat," never shall I forget the sweet expression
		of her elegant and feminine countenance, as it spoke the language
		of love, kindness, or pity; nor shall I ever lose the recollection
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
		of that fine understanding which sparkled through her eye, in the
		brightest scintillations of intellectual energy, and acuteness.
		She was my <i xml:lang="fr">Gamaliel</i>, and no wonder if her lessons, her thoughts,
		her sentiments, have left traces upon my mind not easily to be
		obliterated. When I entered Cambridge, I felt no affection for any
		living creature. Relations I had none, that were not too remote to
		fill the chasm which death had created in my heart. My guardian,
		though an excellent man, only put me painfully in mind of my
		bereavement, when he attempted to condole or advise; and I turned
		from him, not with disrespect, but in disgust with all created
		things.
	</p>

	<p>
		The natural elasticity of youth, and your society, gradually
		reclaimed me from a state which, had it continued, must have ended
		in madness, or idiotcy; and I am able now, at the termination of
		our collegiate career, to think gratefully of prolonged existence,
		and look back with thankfulness.
	</p>

	<p>
		Perhaps you have just laid down my letter to exclaim, "Poor
		Falkland! surely the man
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
								 is bewildered, or he would not tell me
		now, as if for the first time, what I have known these six years."
		Now, my good fellow, be not so hasty in declaring me <i xml:lang="fr">non compos</i>.
		You know the general outline of my story, and you are acquainted
		sufficiently with what you call my romance of character, to find
		in it a constant fund of amusement when we are together; but you
		do not know more than this! You are <em>not</em> aware that the tree
		has adopted its decided inclination from that bias which the twig
		received. Nothing, I feel, can ever make me a man of fashion.
		Nothing, I <em>hope</em>, will loosen the ties which, all unseen as
		they are, bind me to the memory of her by whose judgment, were she
		living, I should desire to be directed in all things to which
		her admirable sense would permit her to apply those reasoning
		powers which never dogmatized, nor lost themselves in the mazes of
		imagination.&mdash;I admired my mother's taste as much as I reverenced
		her virtues&mdash;I respected her talents; and since her death have not
		met with any one capable of interesting me who did not resemble, in
		some
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
			 degree, the character which faithful memory attaches to her
		much-loved image.
	</p>

	<p>
		Different as has been your path from mine, your affectionate
		heart has been my best solace; and though you have been trained
		in the school of modern luxury, which is so little conversant
		with Nature, the generous impulses of your breast have not been
		sacrificed, and you are not <em>yet</em> spoiled by what is called The
		World. For being what you are, you are, I firmly believe, indebted
		in part to original structure; and perhaps, in some degree, to
		that friendship which has united us both at school, and at the
		University.&mdash;Somewhat older, and much graver than you, I have
		always been permitted to take the lead, and exercise an influence
		over your pleasures and pursuits, which, though frequently
		counteracted, has, notwithstanding, communicated an individuality
		to one and the other, that distinguishes you essentially from the
		heartless specimens of human mechanism that pass for men of <em>ton</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		You know what pleasant day-dreams occupy my fancy&mdash;I anticipate
		nothing less than your
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
							   <em>radical reform</em>, from all the follies
		which sometimes obscure your good sense; and I look for this
		change, not as the result of a Hohenlohe miracle, wrought upon
		you through the intercession of the Irish priesthood, but as the
		natural effect of living domesticated with such a family as I
		conceive to be now about to welcome you at Glenalta. I know your
		charming aunt and cousins only through their letters to you; but
		by "these presents," I feel that I cannot be mistaken in the
		attributes with which I have invested them: and, laugh as you like,
		you know that my castles are all built with materials from the
		county of Kerry, in Ireland; and I only say, if it be enthusiasm
		to love and venerate a set of people whom I have never seen&mdash;yes,
		and fully to intend, if life be spared me, to make a pilgrimage in
		quest of your relations, inspired by as much zeal as ever actuated
		the followers of Mahomet in their pious journeys to Mecca, why, let
		me cry with Falstaff, "God help the wicked." A sort of internal
		evidence quite incommunicable to any one else, assures me, that my
		fate is
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
				linked with that of the Douglas family; and I can give you
		no better reason for this belief, than the improbability that so
		much sympathy as draws me towards Glenalta, should be thrown away.
	</p>

	<p>
		However baseless you may consider the fabric of my visions, you
		can at least imagine that, while they possess my mind, they are
		not a little interesting; and therefore I conclude, as I began, by
		entreating that you will feed my Quixotism with journals containing
		the most accurate and minute accounts of all that is said and
		done, planned and projected, at that Ultima Thule, as you call it,
		whither you are bending your steps.
	</p>

	<p>
		The gun is fired as a signal for sailing&mdash;I see an army of
		carpet-bags and portmanteaus in full march, and must say&mdash;farewell!
		God bless you, my dear Howard.
	</p>

	<p class="sigline">
		Your affectionate<br />
		<span class="smcap">Charles Falkland</span>.

	<h3>
		LETTER II.<br />
		<span class="smcap">Miss Douglas to Miss Sandford.</span>
	</h3>

	<p class="salut">
		Dearest Julia,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your letter, which I received yesterday, reproaches me with
		silence, and I plead guilty to the charge, though you are very
		wrong in supposing that my failure in punctuality proceeds from
		weariness of communion with you. I have very few correspondents,
		and amongst these few I rejoice to say, that there is not one, to
		whom I write from any other motive than because I love and value
		every species of intercourse with those who are really dear to my
		heart. I know that it is only necessary to tell you, that I have
		been much engaged, to be certain of your forgiveness; but I should
		not satisfy myself if I did not say how I have been occupied.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
		Shut out as we are from the gay world, and living for weeks
		together without any interruption to our pursuits, even <em>you</em> may
		perhaps wonder that time is not a burthen on our hands. Yet this is
		not the case; but on the contrary, the day appears scarcely set in
		before it has arrived at its close. Is this always the effect of
		full employment, or is it peculiar to the little circle at Glenalta
		to wish that the sun would stand still, and give more of his
		company?&mdash;I am too little acquainted with people and places beyond
		my own home to answer the question; and you are not here to do it
		for me; so now I will proceed with the causes of my long silence.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our dear friend, and invaluable neighbour, Mr. Otway, has been ill:
		thank heaven, he is quite recovered now.&mdash;This dear friend and your
		aunt are, I think, the only people on earth who for the last twelve
		years could have poured the balm of comfort into the desolate
		spirit of my beloved mother&mdash;the latter in becoming a tender parent
		to you and your sisters has had too much care connected with her
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
		immediate duties to admit of her being often with us; but what she,
		under different circumstances, <em>might</em> have been, Mr. Otway has
		been; and what can we ever do sufficiently to prove our gratitude,
		as well as our affection? During his illness, which continued
		for three months, we shared, not only the task of nursing him
		with unremitting assiduity, but endeavoured to supply his place
		by undertaking the labours which, for a series of years, he has
		imposed upon himself. We took care of his schools, we visited his
		sick poor, we distributed his benefactions, became his deputies
		on the roads and in the fields; and resolved that, on his return
		to his gardens and plantations, he should find all things meeting
		him with that pleasant welcome which even the inanimate world is
		enabled to testify, when the hand of diligent affection has taught
		every shrub and flower to glow with its own emotions!&mdash;I know
		nothing more touching than such a reception, which needs no words
		to convince the object of our solicitude, how constantly the heart
		has been occupied in an endeavour to please by the cultivation
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
																	   of
		whatever might confer enjoyment; and the suppression of all that
		would be productive of pain.
	</p>

	<p>
		Though one of the actors in the scene, I will confess to you,
		that the success of our efforts was complete. There was no
		arrangement&mdash;no display that appeared to solicit thanks for our
		faithful stewardship; but I never shall forget the happiness of
		seeing tears, <em>not</em> of grief, stealing from my mother's eyes, while
		our dear friend, leaning upon her arm on one side, and Frederick's
		on the other&mdash;Charlotte, Fanny, and I, bringing up the rear&mdash;took
		his first walk upon the terrace which commands that panorama of
		loveliness and expanse which you admired so much in your visit at
		Glenalta, to which my mind frequently recurs as the most joyful
		period of my existence. In addition to all the blessings of my
		daily life, I had then the enlivening influence of your presence.
		The landscape was the same, but you were the sunshine: and while
		you were here, all seemed "gold and green."&mdash;When will you come
		again, I wonder!&mdash;Well, what a wanderer
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
													 I am! continually
		deviating from my path, my narrative advances but slowly,&mdash;and you
		are yet to learn, that besides our extra employments at his farm,
		we have been as busy as bees preparing for the accommodation of my
		Cousin Arthur Howard, who is expected here to-morrow evening.
	</p>

	<p>
		People who live in towns, or even in what is called <em>civilized</em>
		parts of the country, have little idea how we poor pill-garlicks
		labour to perform what they accomplish as if by the stroke of
		a magical wand. A few words are pronounced in the shape of an
		order, to one of your fashionable upholsterers, and lo! sophas,
		ottomans, tables, arm-chairs, and all the elegant etceteras of
		modern furniture rise up like an exhalation, and are found in their
		exact places, as if a fairy had arranged them. While country folks,
		like us, have to wish, and to wait, for many a long day before we
		can obtain even an imperfect representation of a new luxury. I do
		not complain of this; for I really believe, that we gain by every
		difficulty, and enjoy our humble acquisitions, after going
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
																   through
		much trouble to obtain them, a thousand times more than the rich
		and fashionable do their superfluities, which it is only to desire,
		and to possess; but I state the fact to account for the employment
		of time and pains in filling up a comfortable bed-chamber and
		dressing-room for Arthur Howard, whose approach I dread, not
		because I have any reason to be afraid of him, but because I
		feel how entirely out of his natural (or perhaps I should rather
		say <em>artificial</em>) element, he will find himself in this peaceful
		retreat.
	</p>

	<p>
		I believe I told you in my last letter, that Arthur has been
		very delicate for some months past, and apprehensions have been
		entertained that if the change of air to a softer climate than
		that of Buckinghamshire were not resorted to, his lungs might soon
		become affected. Poor fellow! He is an only son; and as my aunt
		could not make up her mind to going abroad with him herself, and
		she would not consent to let him go to the Continent without her,
		though in the company of his friend Mr. Falkland, matters have
		been compromised by accepting
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
									  mamma's invitation to the <em>Island
		of mists</em>; and truly it would delight us all to cherish this young
		cousin at Glenalta, if it were not for the painful feeling that he
		considers it a heavy penance to come amongst his Irish relations.
		The performance of duty is, however, so agreeable in itself, that
		if we find our cares successful, and are enabled to return the
		invalid in good health to his mother and sisters, we shall be
		amply recompensed. It is but to think of the grateful love which
		would warm our own hearts (were Frederick similarly circumstanced)
		towards any friend who might be instrumental in his recovery,
		to enter <i xml:lang="it">con amore</i> into the feelings of Arthur's family, and
		sing a <i xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i> if we are permitted to excite them. Sickness, in
		producing a powerful sense of our mortality, often awakens the
		heart to the <em>realities</em> of happiness, by shewing us the utter
		futility of pleasures on which we had thoughtlessly relied, till
		evil days came upon us, and our helpless dependence was brought
		experimentally home to our conviction.
	</p>

	<p>
		I sometimes flatter myself with a hope that
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
													mamma's enchanting
		influence, Frederick's sweet disposition, and the cheerful aid of
		the three <em>handmaids</em>, may operate a change in Arthur's mind, and
		reclaim a fine understanding from the blighting effects of cold and
		selfish fashion. You see that I am castle-building&mdash;may it not be
		in the air!
	</p>

	<p>
		I am desired by mamma, to say that your dear aunt shall soon hear
		from her; and you shall have a letter ere long to tell you what
		progress we make in acquaintance with our guest, who is a perfect
		stranger amongst the juniors of our house, and only remembered as a
		little boy by my mother.
	</p>

	<p>
		So much have I had to say of our <em>hospital</em> concerns, that I
		have not told you a word of a surprise which Frederick and I are
		preparing for this precious Author of our being.&mdash;There is a little

		LETTER III. <br />
		<span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Charles Falkland.</span>
	</h3>

	<p class="salut">
		My Dear Falkland,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your letter from Dover has travelled many a mile in quest of
		me; first into Buckinghamshire, then to Grosvenor-square,
		"tried" Cambridge, and <i xml:lang="la">non est inventus</i> being the return made
		at each of these places, it has followed me into the wilds of
		Kerry in Ireland. Here I am actually at Glenalta, and as I mean
		faithfully to perform my promise, and execute the task which you
		have so solemnly <em>spread out</em> before me, in such detail that I
		am not likely to forget the engagement, I shall <em>begin from the
		beginning</em>, for the following cogent reasons: first, that I may
		be correct by not trusting to memory; secondly, that I may not be
		overwhelmed by an inconvenient accumulation of materials, thirdly
		and lastly, because to vent my spleen in a letter
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
														  is next to the
		relief of doing so in a <i xml:lang="it">viva voce</i> unburthening, disemboguing, or
		whatever else you choose to call this pouring out of my vexations.
	</p>

	<p>
		After a journey through a horrible country, as naked as if it
		was but just born, and as comfortless as if it had never been
		inhabited, I reached at last my haven of rest yesterday evening at
		six o'clock. You must not expect me to name places which I cannot
		spell, nor jolt over such roads as I have escaped again with you.
		This would indeed be "thrice to slay the slain," for I am in a
		state of mummy this morning. If David had known the county of
		Kerry, I should believe that it rose upon his mind, when he wrote
		of the judges that were overthrown in stony places. As I approached
		within a mile of my journey's end I should possibly have been put
		into good humour, if my temper had not been previously so ruffled
		as to counteract the influence of pleasanter impressions. Candour
		obliges me to confess, that nothing in nature can exceed the
		scenery of this spot when <em>once you are at it</em>; but in my present
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
		feelings I doubt whether I would go to Heaven itself, if there
		were no better road thither than that by which I have achieved my
		safe landing at Glenalta. Part of my way lay through a morass,
		technically called <em>bog</em> in this country, which brought to my
		recollection every frightful engulfment that I ever heard or read
		of. The vast American swamps, the Indian jungles, aye, even "that
		great Lerborian bog 'twixt Damietta and the sea," so finely touched
		by Milton, appeared safe and smooth to my imagination in comparison
		with the dark abysses that seemed to yawn upon me from either
		side of my gloomy and monotonous path. No, it is not in human
		nature to recover a man's equilibrium after what I have suffered
		in less than a week; and therefore the features of this <i xml:lang="fr">cul de
		sac</i>, which has nothing beyond it but the waves of the Atlantic,
		will stand but a bad chance of being sketched in any other than
		<em>distemper</em> colouring, if I must <em>fix</em> my first impressions. Your
		orders, however, concur with my bile, and thus duty and inclination
		happily coincide, which is somewhat uncommon. Well, "through mud
		and mire,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
				  brake and brier," I at last beheld the termination of
		my woes, and drove up in a post chaise, which I firmly believe sat
		for its picture to Miss Edgeworth, and found myself in front of a
		verandah, which, in any other place and any other at time, might
		have seemed a bower of enchantment; but my eyes were jaundiced,
		my bones were weary, and every thought was steeped in vinegar, so
		cross, cold, sour, and discontented did I feel, as the lubberly
		brute, called post-boy by a strange misnomer, trundled off his
		jaded horse, and thumping up like a sack against the hall door,
		gave a knock which might have been heard in Labrador. I expected
		to have been met and smothered on the threshold by my aunt and
		cousins, but a servant only made his appearance, and the step was
		let down; Lewis had descended, and I was fairly on my feet, and
		trying to pump up a smile upon my countenance, lest its previous
		expression should stamp my character irretrievably, ere in two
		minutes I found myself affectionately greeted and as affectionately
		dismissed to my apartments, for I have got a <i xml:lang="fr">suite</i> allotted to
		me, and as I was
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
						 preparing to obey, and retire, my aunt, with
		one of the sweetest voices I ever heard, begged that I would not
		hurry myself. "Frederick my love," added she, "I depend upon your
		shewing dear Arthur his room, and I need not remind you that as
		he is an invalid, he must not be asked to do any thing in the
		least distressing, or requiring effort. Arthur, you will I hope
		feel yourself <em>at home</em>, and that charming little word comprises
		all that I can offer you, and so <em>much</em>, that I should weaken its
		force, if I attempted by any addition to render it more impressive."
	</p>

	<p>
		When I was dressed, I went down stairs, and opening a door that
		lay on my right hand, found myself in a snug library and alone.
		Supposing this to be the room in which we were to muster before
		dinner, I took up some books which lay on the table, and what
		should I discover? why, positively that I have got amongst a
		batch of <em>Blues</em>. Full ten minutes elapsed before my rapid survey
		was interrupted; and in that short period I found the initials
		of Emily and Charlotte annexed to the name of Douglas, in at
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
		least a dozen volumes, one of which was Sallust, a second Virgil,
		a third Sowerby on Minerals, a fourth some one, I forget who,
		upon Botany, and so on. I absolutely felt my cheeks glow with
		shame and indignation. What! set down in a nook of the county of
		Kerry, in Ireland, without a creature to speak to, who I suppose
		ever saw "a good man's feast," though I dare say they are not
		without "bells that call to church;" and to find myself not only
		shut out from the world, but screwed in a vice as it were, with
		all manner of pedantry, and required to talk science all day
		to a set of <i xml:lang="fr">precieuses ridicules</i>! it was too much for <em>my</em>
		constitution I assure you; and with the celerity of lightning I
		resolved to construct an apology, as quickly as possible, for my
		speedy departure. The <em>manner</em> of disengaging myself from the
		noose still remains to be determined, but it is quite plain that
		at Blue-Stocking Hall, which is a much more appropriate name than
		Glenalta, I cannot stay.
	</p>

	<p>
		My aunt's letters never threw light upon the accomplishments
		of her daughters, and as one
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
									 does not take much interest in
		the occupations of the elders in a family, her own literary
		propensities would not have annoyed me at all, particularly, too,
		as I might probably find able assistance in Frederick whenever I
		had a mind to laugh at learned ladies. But to my narrative,&mdash;the
		first who entered the room was Fanny, the youngest of the family.
		She is about fifteen, strikingly pretty, with almost the funniest
		expression of countenance that I ever saw, and thank Heaven, of
		an age to be treated as a child. <em>She</em> will, I see, be my sheet
		anchor while I am obliged to tarry on this coast. My aunt and her
		<em>Aspasias</em> followed before I had time to utter a sentence, and
		Frederick brought up the rear. In the moment of his entrance, the
		servant who was at his heels, announced dinner, and while we were
		crossing the hall, my aunt said, "You were in the library while
		we were waiting your arrival in the drawing-room, so we missed
		the pleasure of your company, my dear boy, for I know not how
		long. Arthur, I know how disagreeable it is to be watched with
		too great
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
				  anxiety, so to day you shall eat and drink as you find
		that you <em>can</em> do; and if there is any thing that you are in the
		habit of taking, or any thing that you would like to try, I can
		promise you the aid of three of the kindest nurses that ever took
		care of an invalid. They have had great experience, and will be
		delighted to be useful to you." I thanked her, secretly resolving
		to give my fair cousins as little trouble as possible, and down
		we sat to dinner, which was not a bit like what I supposed it
		would have been, but actually <em>got up</em> in excellent style. We had
		two nice little courses of capital materials that might have done
		credit to the London market; admirably dressed, served up quite
		in a civilized manner, and, would you believe it, not a word of
		<em>azure</em> during the repast. Don't fancy me, however, the block-head
		to cry roast-meat before I am out of the wood. Indigo itself could
		scarcely have found opportunity to display its tints in the midst
		of all the inquiries for mother, sisters, uncles, aunts, that
		happily filled the intervals of carving and eating. In all my life
		I never
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
				felt so much indebted to my relations before; and when the
		ladies got up to leave the room, not a word had escaped their lips
		which was not delivered in their vernacular language; and by the
		bye, I will tell you what appears to me very extraordinary, that
		not one of this family speaks with that horrible accent, vulgarly
		called <i xml:lang="ga">brogue</i>. No, positively they all express themselves
		remarkably well, and what is also strange enough, they are very
		elegant, and modern in their appearance. In short, I should not be
		ashamed of the <i xml:lang="fr">coup d'[oe]il</i> of the house and its inhabitants,
		were it not for this cursed <em>blue</em> which will burst upon me in a
		torrent to-morrow, and be no doubt the more impetuous in its flow,
		for having been dammed up during so many hours.
	</p>

	<p>
		When left alone with Fred. who seems a very honest sort of fellow,
		I found that he was a sportsman, I suppose in a coarse way; but
		still here is a resource, and he tells me that he has excellent
		greyhounds and setters; that game abounds in these mountains;
		and that there is good fun to be had at small cost of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
															  labour.
		<i xml:lang="fr">Tant mieux</i> for an invalid. We sat for an hour without drinking
		much wine, from which I am under orders to abstain till this
		plaguy chest of mine is well, and to which my companion seemed
		to have no natural propensity. We then joined the party in the
		drawing-room, and there I found Emily writing music, Charlotte
		tuning a harp,&mdash;yes, a very fine one too, Fanny rolling a ball for
		a beautiful little spaniel, and her mother smiling at its gambols.
	</p>

	<p>
		There was nothing appalling here, but the evening was young;
		however, here was a <em>new</em> resource, and with grateful alacrity I
		hastened to beg for a soft strain of Erin. Certainly I am lost
		in astonishment. Do you know that these girls sing like syrens?
		Nothing can be in finer harmony than their voices, and some of the
		simple Irish airs which were sung this evening, have so completely
		taken possession of my mind, that I shall dream of nothing else.
		Why will women be so absurd as to mistake the true feminine
		character, and, despising the sceptre which nature has placed in
		their hands,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
					 relinquish a legitimate and undisputed empire, to
		engage in the silly project of conquest over regions which will
		never submit to their arms?
	</p>

	<p>
		Were it not for the farrago of Latin, Greek, botany, chemistry,
		and the devil knows what, with which my ears are to be assailed,
		how readily should I bear testimony to the charms which sweet
		music and good manners possess; and when I consider (and I really
		speak impartially), the fund upon which the Douglas girls might
		fairly <em>trade</em>, I am at a loss to perceive the motive for all this
		nonsense of learning. If they were ugly or old, or surrounded
		by professors, there might be some reason for experimenting in
		literary lore, and hoisting a blue flag; but young, pleasing,
		singularly elegant, with heavenly voices, what is it that the
		fools would be at? I suppose that my poor aunt, whose affliction
		I fancy made her a recluse for several years, has insisted upon
		making scholars of the sisterhood, because Fred's tutor, who of
		course was some antiquated piece of furniture, had time to spare,
		and probably knew about as much of life and manners, as Noah
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
																	 did
		in the Ark. If this be the case, I shall soon find out all about
		the matter, and my visit here may be a blessing, as I shall take
		the very first opportunity that offers of opening aunty's eyes
		to the impolicy of her conduct, by assuring her that men of the
		<em>present</em> day dread a <em>blue</em> more than a scorpion, which argument,
		I believe, never failed yet with a <em>mamma</em>; and as to the poor
		girls, it will be easy to work upon their minds without being
		ungallant. To be sure they cannot unlearn all that old domine
		has crammed into their noddles, but if they are frightened into
		a careful concealment, there is not much harm done; for if after
		they are married, they can put their boys through the Latin grammar
		and Selecta, the employment will not be disagreeable to them, the
		children may benefit, and if they should settle in Ireland, I mean
		in the country, no body need be the wiser for their latinity.
		Fanny is young enough to snatch from contagion, and with her merry
		phiz, she ought not to drudge over <i xml:lang="la">Hic hæc hoc</i>. I could not help
		thinking of Marmontel's description (is it not?) of <i xml:lang="fr">Agathe</i>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
																					 in
		the <i xml:lang="fr">Misanthrope</i>, when I looked at her, "<i xml:lang="fr">La plus jolie espiegle
		que l'Amour eut jamais formé</i>," and as I applied these words, I
		resolved to save her if possible.
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, tea, coffee, and milk-cakes, as good of their kinds as you
		ever tasted, succeeded by the harp and piano-forte, left me no
		time for a game of chess to which Frederick had challenged me on
		entering the room. At ten o'clock a tray made its appearance with
		some really fine fruit, and the best milk I ever tasted; nothing
		could be more easy, cheerful, and pleasant than our little party;
		and so entirely were books left out of the evening's amusement,
		that what I had seen before dinner was never remembered till I
		reached my own room; we were as gay as larks, and even danced some
		quadrille figures. Here again surprise is no word to express what
		I felt at seeing my cousins acquit themselves with a grace that
		would actually be quite <i xml:lang="fr">distingué</i> at Almack's. A little <em>fashion</em>
		might be added, but nothing can be better than the flexibility and
		perfect ear which accompany every movement of these mountaineers.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
		So far so good, but old Solon used to say "the end is not come
		yet," and I felt all the prudence of suspended judgment conveyed
		in his <em>laconicism</em>, when on the removal of the tray, Frederick
		placed a large book before his mother, and having rung the bell, I
		found myself presently engaged,&mdash;yes, actually engaged in family
		prayers with no less than six domestics and an old non-descript
		with grey hair, who hobbled in leaning upon a stick, and for whose
		accommodation Fanny placed a cushion; all ranged along the end
		of the room: it was a complete <em>take in</em>, and I never felt more
		awkwardly in all my life. However there was no escaping, and I had
		nothing for it but submission. My aunt, to do her justice, gave us
		a short prayer, and I cannot say that there was any <em>cant</em> in it;
		but conceive the bad taste of following this part of the ceremony
		by reading a chapter in the New Testament, and during the time,
		sitting "hail fellows well met" in the midst of the servants, who
		took to their seats as naturally as if they had been born to five
		thousand a year each.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
		Now my good friend, <em>you</em> stand up for these exhibitions; but to
		see the gentry of the country thus brought on a level with their
		footmen; and to see a girl of Fanny's appearance fly to help
		old Lawrence, whose stick slipped as he was about to retire, I
		must ever think revolting to common sense, and I went to my room
		determined to hasten my departure as much as possible. Of course I
		conclude that my antediluvian relations go through this religious
		mummery twice a day; and though you know that I am not of the
		infidel school, I hate piety in such clothing as I find it dressed
		in here; and as I equally dislike old fashions and <em>new</em> lights,
		I shall get rid of the one and the other as fast as I can. I must
		not offend people, however, who are kindly inclined to me, and
		therefore you may address one letter at least to this place. Good
		night, and believe me, in a confounded cross humour,
	</p>

		Truly yours<br />

	<h3>
		LETTER IV. <br />
		<span class="smcap">Mrs. Douglas to Mrs. E. Sandford.</span>
	</h3>


	<p class="salut">
		My dearly loved Friend,
	</p>

	<p>
		And are you really once more in your own Derbyshire, enjoying the
		blessing of rest after all your wanderings? My heart flies to bid
		you welcome at Checkley, where your presence, I doubt not, was
		long desired and affectionately greeted, though not perhaps with
		such energy as is conveyed in our Irish "Cead Millagh farthagh."
		But how doubly blessed is your return, and how largely has a
		merciful Providence repaid your labours, and compensated for every
		privation that you have endured, by restoring the sweet Agnes to
		perfect health! You are a mother, in almost every sense of that
		comprehensive title, to three dear and doubly orphaned girls, who
		now employ your whole attention;
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
										 and though you have been spared
		those anxieties, incident to the relation of parent, which belong
		exclusively to the tender years of infancy, you can sympathize in
		all the solicitude to which the unfoldings of youth give birth; and
		thus a new bond has arisen to link our souls together.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now that the peril is past, that which was toil while actually
		present, becomes pleasure when viewed in the distance; and thus it
		is that the great Dispenser of Good rewards the patient performance
		of duty.
	</p>

	<p>
		You longed to be at home, and you are safely lodged within its
		delightful retreat; while your girls like bees have been collecting
		honey from every flower to enrich their hive, and no longer
		indebted to "books and swains alone," for their knowledge of the
		world, can talk of Switzerland, and Italy, and France with all the
		many who have visited their shores. <em>My</em> holidays are yet to come;
		but do not be frightened; I am not thinking of the Continent&mdash;I am
		only running forward with my mind's eye to the happy accomplishment
		of our mutual wishes in the meeting at this dear spot of which your
		promise holds
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
					  out the exhilarating prospect. My children seem
		to feel that months are years, till August comes and brings the
		Sandfords to Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		But dearest Elizabeth, I am not answering your question: "Will you
		help me with your experience in this weighty task which I have
		undertaken, and give me your advice upon the important subject of
		female education, as I proceed in an endeavour to fulfil the part
		which I have engaged to act?" Yes surely, my friend, I will gladly
		afford you every aid in my power to bestow, but you will not expect
		more than I can give. You must not look to me for that which I have
		never found myself, namely a plan or system by which I could work
		under the guidance of another mind without exercising at every
		moment whatever penetration the Almighty had conferred upon my own.
		This, whatever be its measure, has been employed night and day in
		scrutinizing the individual varieties that presented themselves in
		the several dispositions of my children.
	</p>

	<p>
		You know the little history of their infant years, and that they
		were ever with me. You
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
							   know also of the frightful chasm in my
		life, which succeeded. I dare not even now look back upon that
		period, nor is it necessary; for you have nothing to do with the
		first years of childhood: but till this moment I never told you of
		the <em>heart-sting</em> by which I was roused from that torpor which had
		diffused a species of Upas shade over my character for some years.
	</p>

	<p>
		While I was buried in my cottage near Linton, in Devonshire, I
		was attacked by low fever which threatened my life. It was not
		contagious, and therefore I was not debarred from seeing my
		children. Frederick, the eldest, was then twelve years old, and one
		day when he and his little sisters came to kiss and say farewell
		before they took their walk, I perceived my dear boy's cheek wet as
		it touched mine, and almost in the same instant that the tiny group
		hurried from my room I found a scrap of paper lying on the pillow
		upon which my head was reclined. I opened and read the following
		artless effusion addressed
	</p>

	<p class="center">
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
		<i>"To my beloved Mamma.</i>
	</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<span class="i0">And wilt <em>thou also</em> fall asleep?</span>
		<span class="i0">And must we never cease to weep?</span>
		<span class="i0">And can'st thou breathe a long farewell</span>
		<span class="i0">To those whose little bosoms swell</span>
		<span class="i0">With love, that would thy sorrows cheer,</span>
		<span class="i0">With grief, that finds no solace here?</span>
		<span class="i0">Oh take us to the realms of light,</span>
		<span class="i0">Or stay awhile thy spirit's flight</span>
		<span class="i0">Tho' angels beckon: hear our prayer,</span>
		<span class="i0">Nor leave thy children to despair!"</span>
	</div>

	<p>
		This first lisping of an almost infant muse produced an electric
		effect, and seemed the proximate instrument to inspire a degree of
		resolution which till then had been denied to my prayers; for God
		does his work in our hearts by secondary means and not by miracles.
		From that hour my mind appeared gradually to receive strength. I
		began to feel that solitude was too selfish an enjoyment; that I
		had <em>active</em> duties which claimed a share of my thoughts. I prayed
		earnestly, I exerted myself unceasingly, recovered health, and then
		determined on the great sacrifice of re-visiting Glenalta. The
		anguish, which
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
					   that effort cost me, it would be as impossible for
		me to express, as it would be painful to you to conceive. Enough
		of this! Your request for assistance in your new character has led
		me back through a labyrinth of past time, and my pen has almost
		unconsciously pursued the train.
	</p>

	<p>
		The excellent tutor who was procured for me by my invaluable
		friend Edward Otway, seemed as if formed expressly for my purpose.
		I could not have borne the society of any mortal who expected
		to be made a companion, nor could I have allowed my children to
		associate with a person who did not deserve to be made a friend.
		Mr. Oliphant, old enough to be my father, yet cheerful enough to
		be the play-fellow of my children when he was not their teacher,
		religious, benevolent, learned, simple in his manners, enthusiastic
		both in acquiring and imparting knowledge, and never desiring
		other company than that of his pupils and his books, was the man
		whom I found at Lisfarne under the roof of my friend, and waiting
		the arrival of my family at Glenalta. A few dreadful struggles
		over, we commenced upon the "noiseless tenor of our
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
															way." I read
		every volume of which I had ever heard upon education, and found
		instruction in a short paper upon the subject, written by the late
		Mrs. Barbauld, whose pen was called upon to direct the conduct of
		a father and mother who found themselves the parents of a darling
		only son, and possessed of such affluence as to induce them to give
		a <i xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> for whatever might be suggested as most likely to
		succeed in making this object of their common affection all that
		they fondly desired to see him.
	</p>

	<p>
		Her letter in reply to their solicitations for advice, was
		published many years ago in a periodical work entitled "The
		Inquirer," and contains more strong good sense in a few pages than
		I have ever met with in the many ponderous quartos which maternal
		anxiety induced me to wade through. Mrs. Barbauld tells her friends
		<em>to be</em> themselves in daily life, in all their habits of speaking
		and acting, <em>that</em> which they desire to impress upon their son. The
		quantity of Greek and Latin, logic, and mathematics, which he might
		attain in the progress of his studies, or the place in which such
		knowledge should
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
						 be acquired, she wisely leaves in a great measure
		to other advisers; and resting on what is surely of far higher
		consequence in the human compound, namely the principles, the
		sentiments, the opinions which it is desirable should actuate the
		conduct of the future man, she admirably remarks that the <i>moral
		atmosphere</i> by which youth is surrounded, is the real teacher&mdash;not
		the tutor or governess who lays down precepts in the closet.
	</p>

	<p>
		We are told in holy writ, that "the children of this world are
		wiser in their generation than the children of light," and we may
		fairly draw a similar comparison between the young and the more
		advanced of our fellow creatures upon earth. The whole <em>strength</em>
		of a child lies in his sagacity, which accounts for all the
		acuteness employed by young people in observing looks and actions,
		and in developing the secret motives of those in whose conduct
		they are interested. In low minds this acuteness degenerates into
		cunning, but in all children there is a quickness of intellect,
		a readiness in deducing effects from causes, and marking
		inconsistencies between
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
								theory and practice, which ought to
		operate as a powerful incentive with those who undertake the care
		of youth, to make singleness of heart and a broad bold integrity
		the rule of every act in life. It is in vain that we talk of the
		beauty of truth, while we employ dissimulation in our intercourse
		with society; or descant on the advantages of occupation, while
		our own days are passed in idleness and sloth. <em>Words</em> go for very
		little, whilst it is what we are <em>doing</em> that secretly determines
		the bias of our children either to imitate or avoid. Powerfully
		impressed with this leading truth, I endeavoured to act upon my
		conviction. My rules were simple, few, and determined. I avoided
		as much as possible the multiplication of <em>decrees</em>, and, where it
		was practicable, rather sought to shew my little flock the path in
		which I wished them to walk by accompanying their steps, than to
		point out by prohibition that which was to be avoided. The success
		with which a merciful Providence has blessed my humble efforts
		is not granted to all in the same <em>degree</em>; but all must try for
		the goal, though
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
						 it may not be given to reach it in every case.
		The original structure of the human mind is after all the great
		thing, and our best endeavours can but improve or restrain; but
		will never <em>create</em>. That belongs to higher influence. You know my
		feelings, and how much I prize one unselfish movement of the heart
		above all the intellect that ever adorned the greatest philosopher;
		and therefore it is that I have tried with such incessant care
		to cultivate the affections of my children. Here again nature
		must co-operate; for there are characters so phlegmatic, so cold,
		so inclined to contradiction, that no kindness will warm them
		into confidence and love. But though we do not make sufficient
		allowance for the vast variety of constitutional temperament, and
		too frequently expect equal results from different soils, which
		will always disappoint our hopes; a careful study of the materials
		upon which we are to act, and a judicious application of culture
		according to the <em>grain</em> and <em>character</em> of those materials, will
		seldom fail of repaying our labours by such harvest as it is
		reasonable to anticipate.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
		I have, you see, only attempted here to give you a loose sketch of
		my ground plan. You must ask specific questions, to which you shall
		have the best replies in my power to give: but if I go on tacking
		my thoughts together <em>generally</em> upon the subject of education, I
		may be giving you what you do not want. Tell me, then, all your
		difficulties as they arise, and as far as my experience can remove
		them you may rely upon my inclination to assist your virtuous
		resolution of supplying a parent's place to your poor brother's
		orphans.
	</p>

	<p>
		The many volumes devoted to the subject of education are frequently
		written by people who have, like the spider, spun out the web of
		their theories from within, and then applied those tissues to
		creatures of their own imagination, fitting and conforming the one
		to the other as nicely as Cinderella's slipper was found to suit
		the princess for whose foot it had been made. Such books remind me
		of a fine contrivance which should be devised with mathematical
		precision by one wholly unacquainted with practical operations.
		The machine is set
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
						   going, and the influence of friction alone,
		upon which our philosopher had never calculated in his closet, is
		sufficient to overset the entire speculation.
	</p>

	<p>
		I must now employ the remainder of my paper in mentioning the
		arrival of my nephew Arthur Howard. His health is far from being
		robust: but I flatter myself <em>already</em> that our balmy breezes from
		the sea, and fragrant gales from the heath-covered mountains, which
		nearly surround this little glen, have been of use to him. Nothing
		could be more delightful to my heart than his perfect recovery,
		if I might hope that, with renewed health, he were to inhale
		amongst us some better notions (for I cannot dignify his nonsense
		with the title of <em>opinions</em>) than the silly society of his poor
		mother, and those vapid votaries of fashion with whom her hours
		are passed, have infused into his youthful mind. Arthur is not
		more than twenty, and has so good an understanding, combined with
		a remarkably open, candid nature, that I cannot bear to think of
		his being misled by vanity and folly. He is very engaging, though
		in the high
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
					road to be spoiled, if we cannot, by some necromancy,
		contrive to make him love our peaceful pleasures at Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is to me a source of great amusement as well as delight to be
		a silent observer of the group by which I am encircled. I had
		prepared my dear Frederick and his sisters to find their cousin
		frank and amiable, but sadly led astray by the tyranny of fashion;
		and it is really more interesting than I can express, to behold the
		sweet assiduities of these beloved children in administering to his
		wants, endeavouring to promote his amusement, and softening his
		prejudices by the most endearing kindness, and gentle, judicious
		opposition. So nice is the tact which singleness of heart, and
		affection inspire, that I have not had once to animadvert upon
		any part of their manners towards our young guest since he came
		amongst us, and as all their innocent projects for his reformation,
		and delicate remarks upon the progress or failure of their little
		schemes are imparted with the glow of confiding sympathy to me, I
		am charmed with the discoveries which I am thus enabled to make in
		the dispositions of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
							my children, through circumstances calculated
		to place them in new lights to my view.
	</p>

	<p>
		My mind undergoes variety of emotion in considering Arthur, whose
		conflicts of spirit I can clearly penetrate. Sometimes diverted
		beyond measure by his rising indignation, I can scarcely preserve
		my gravity when I see his choler ready to burst into furious
		invective against the many pursuits in which my girls are occupied
		<em>so new</em> to him; then checked ere it has exploded by some sprightly
		sally on their part, or by his own evidently growing attachment
		to their pleasant society. Emily reasons with him, Charlotte
		expostulates, and Fanny banters so playfully with her cousin,
		that her merriment seems always with a magic touch to restore his
		temper to its equipoise. Arthur you know has been bred up in the
		school of <em>the world</em>, and holds all its doctrines with tenacity.
		Accomplishments make up all his idea of female education. To sing,
		play on the harp and piano-forte, speak French, and know enough of
		Italian to quote a line from Metastasio, are the utmost extent to
		which he would permit a woman's lore to extend. Any thing
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
																  more
		than this, every degree of literary information beyond the poems of
		Lord Byron or an Album, is voted <em>blue</em>, and Arthur's eloquence is
		in continual exercise upon the absurdity, inutility, and vulgarity
		of <em>learning in a lady</em>. His tirades are met with such perfect good
		humour, and he is so frequently indebted to those resources in
		his cousins which he affects to despise for varying the pleasures
		of his day, that I prophesy a change in his opinions, but it will
		not be wrought all at once. We must patiently endure some more
		reproach, ere our young man of fashion will declare himself a
		convert, but such is the charm of <em>mind over matter</em>, that I think
		we shall conquer in the end.

	<h2>
		LETTER V.
		<span class="smcap">Arthur Howard to Charles Falkland.</span>
	</h2>

	<p class="salut">
		My dear Falkland,
	</p>

	<p>
		Here comes the day for sealing my promised packet, which you will
		find to contain the last week's register of matters and things
		as time glides on at Glenalta.&mdash;Well; shall I begin by giving
		you this day's impression, or travel, like a crab, backwards, in
		order to get forward? As the latter will be in the Irish style,
		and also conformable to my promise, I suppose that I must give it
		the preference. To return then&mdash;I made up my budget on Wednesday
		night, went to bed, tossed about rather feverishly for an hour or
		two, partly from this plaguy cough, which was, I conclude, excited
		by my journey, and partly, no doubt, from the irritation of my
		temper. Sleep, however, that
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
									 "sweet restorer," as <em>our</em> poet so
		beautifully calls it, came ere long to my aid, and my eyes were
		closed until they opened at once upon Lewis, and the most brilliant
		sunshine I ever beheld!
	</p>

	<p>
		"Lewis, I will get up before the family are stirring&mdash;I want to
		look about me, and see something of this place before breakfast."
		"Lord, sir," replied my squire, "the people of this house I believe
		live without sleep, at least if I may judge by what I have seen as
		yet. I was up myself at half past six, and the young ladies were
		coming then from the sea when I went down stairs. They are off upon
		some other prank now, for I saw two of them on donkies, and Mr.
		Frederick is, I know not where, but certainly not in his room, for
		the door and windows of it are wide open."
	</p>

	<p>
		I jumped up, and at eight o'clock sallied forth in quest of
		adventures. The Glen, in which my aunt's dwelling is situated,
		is most assuredly quite lovely; and this time of the year is so
		charming in itself, that it is provoking that all things here
		should not be in harmony. Just conceive a set of Blue Stockings
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
		in a scene fit for nothing but love-music and romance,&mdash;faith it
		is mortifying; not that I am near so angry as I was when I last
		wrote. No; they are all very prudent, I must own; but the accursed
		thing is <em>there</em>, and only waiting for an opportunity to overwhelm
		me;&mdash;but to my diary.
	</p>

	<p>
		I had not gone ten yards from the hall door, along a winding
		pathway that leads through a wood to the sea, when, fascinated
		by the beauty of every thing around me, I thought that I would
		run back for my sketch-book, and try if I could not at least take
		<em>notes</em> of the view near the house, particularly as I shall leave
		it so soon, before I joined the family party. Just as I regained my
		own room, I met pretty Fan, looking like a rose-bud. "Fred. and I
		have been searching every where for you, Arthur, to give you your
		little <em>dose</em> of milk warm from the cow, which I am determined
		shall cure your cough, and make you as fat as my Flora." So saying,
		off she skipped, desiring me to wait for her return, and in a few
		seconds she came back in the character of Hebe, bearing
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
																a goblet
		of high-frothed milk instead of nectar, not for Jupiter, but your
		humble servant. Never having been paid such an attention in all my
		life before, I felt rather at a nonplus. Not a line from Scott,
		Byron, or any of our British bards!&mdash;no, not even the "Thought
		upon new milk," at which you and I have laughed in the Rolliad,
		came to my relief. Not intimate enough to be thus served by a
		princess of the castle, without returning <em>some</em> acknowledgment,
		and nothing either chivalric or poetical starting to my <em>rescue</em>,
		I was completely <em>at fault</em>, and looked, perhaps for the first
		time, something like Simon Pure. Fanny, however, did not seem to
		observe any thing but the main point of whether the draught were
		honestly dregged to the very bottom.&mdash;"Drink it all; the conserve
		of roses, I dare say, will reward the last gulp,&mdash;there, that is a
		dear boy&mdash;it will do you good;" and away flitted my nymph of the
		mountain, saying, as she sped along, that she would come and walk
		with me in a moment. Scarcely had I lost sight of her, before she
		was back again; and all animation, with youth,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
													   health, and good
		humour, she ran up to me and said&mdash;"Old Lawrence does not treat me
		so formally as you do; <em>he</em> does not look surprised when I offer
		him a glass of milk; but smiles kindly, with a 'bless you, missy,'
		as my reward."
	</p>

	<p>
		"What," answered I, "have you been meting out your favors this
		morning to a set of pensioners, amongst whom I have the honour
		to be classed? If that be the case, <em>my</em> gratitude might be
		taken from the general tribute, and hardly missed."&mdash;"Oh, then,
		I see how it is," replied my little coz, "you are offended at me
		for having taken care of a helpless old man in company with a
		smart and fashionable young one; but you will not be angry when
		I tell you, that this dear old soul is the precious mother's
		foster-father." "And pray, my amiable Fan, what is the meaning of
		<em>foster</em>-father, for in my life I never happened to hear of such a
		relation."&mdash;"Well, you astonish me, Arthur; I find that you have a
		great deal to learn. Old Lawrence, or Lorry, as you will soon be
		taught to call him, was husband to mamma's nurse. Nanny is dead,
		and much
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
				 did we grieve for her; but it is a great consolation
		for her loss, that we are enabled to make her excellent and aged
		partner so happy and comfortable as he is at Glenalta. Remember,
		too, that the blessed sun does not shine less brightly upon you,
		dear Arthur, because it warms our poor old man: and when you think
		of this, you will never grudge him a share of Drimindhu's milk."
	</p>

	<p>
		"And who, may I ask, is Drimindhu?" rejoined I. "A favourite cow.
		Our Kerry cows are beautiful, and not unlike those of Alderney; but
		Drim is my own property, and her milk is better than any other;
		at least, <em>I</em> think so, or I would not give it to you and Lorry.
		Have your sisters <em>pets</em> of this kind at Selby?" "No, indeed, <em>my</em>
		sisters know very little of cows; and I question whether they
		ever heard that it is these animals which supply us with milk.
		Louisa and Adelaide live for a great part of every year in town,
		and when they go down into Buckinghamshire, or to Brighton, or
		elsewhere, they ride and drive, but never take any part in domestic
		affairs."&mdash;"Well,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
							   then," answered Fanny, "I am sorry for it&mdash;they
		lose a very great pleasure by not cultivating a love for the
		country and its pursuits. The act of loving is so delightful, that
		it always seems like the soul's sunshine; and I never understand
		the character of the Deity so well as when I think of Him as a God
		of Love."
	</p>

	<p>
		Though I could not refrain from smiling, I felt for the time that
		Fanny's view of things was very contagious. The splendor of a May
		morning, the freshness of Nature, and the concert of singing birds,
		had put me into a disposition to be pleased, and the simplicity of
		this dear little girl had all the stimulating effect of novelty on
		my senses.
	</p>

	<p>
		At this moment, turning round a wooded knoll which we had been
		skirting while thus engaged in a sort of conversation so unlike
		what I had ever been accustomed to, a group of three donkies
		appeared in view. "Here they come," exclaimed Fanny; and, darting
		with the fleetness of a greyhound, she flew to meet her sisters,
		who were attended by a peasant-boy,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
											carrying a basket before
		him. Nothing could be more picturesque than the scene, and it
		was much heightened by the approach of these rustic equestrians.
		While I was moving towards them, a fine pointer passed me by at
		full speed, and a tap on my shoulder announced Frederick, who came
		running across the grass to join the party. A few moments brought
		us together, and, to my amazement, the brother and sisters met with
		as much demonstration of gladness at sight of each other as Louisa,
		Adelaide, and I could have mustered after a year's separation.
		The effect was pleasant; and, if <em>sincere</em>, this affection which
		the people here discover towards each other has something very
		<em>comfortable</em> in it; but it is only calculated for this sort of
		place, and, like hospitality, naturally flies into these recesses
		of the earth, where the objects are scarce upon which one's
		practice can be exercised. Politeness is necessary to a <em>certain</em>
		degree in the world, and even <em>that</em> may be overdone; but beyond
		this how little of the heart does one see brought into play, and
		indeed
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
			   on a great theatre the thing would be impracticable, if it
		were not such a bore as to render an attempt to love every one that
		a man meets as absurd as it is impossible. But I digress.&mdash;Large
		coarse straw hats shaded my pretty cousins from the sun, which
		shone brightly. The eldest has a peculiar expression, made up
		of the intellectual and pensive, which is singularly agreeable,
		though her features are not regular enough for what requires no
		periphrasis to describe, but is at once called beauty. Charlotte
		is very pleasing also; her countenance is less strongly marked
		than Emily's by reflection, but it is quick as lightning&mdash;and full
		of sensibility; while Fanny's face exhibits a mixture of all the
		varied characteristics of both her sisters', or may perhaps be more
		properly denominated a mirror, in which every movement of <em>their</em>
		minds that makes it way to the surface, is shadowed with fidelity.
	</p>

	<p>
		All were in a hurry to get home lest my aunt should be kept
		waiting a moment; and so quick were the subsequent operations,
		that Frederick has assisted the two damsels from
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
														 their donkies,
		the riding costume was <em>doffed</em>, as if by magic; and ere it
		seemed possible to have gone through half the preliminary work of
		preparation for breakfast, a bell tingled, and hastily pocketing
		my sketch-book, I quitted my station near the house, where I had
		lingered to make a memorandum of the spot, and was met at the door
		by Fred. who stopped my entrance, saying, "Arthur, my mother fears
		it may not be agreeable to you to attend family prayers; and,
		as you are an invalid, I am desired to say, that you are not to
		consider yourself bound to our hours, or observances; therefore, my
		dear fellow, as you have of course said your own prayers, do not
		think it necessary to join us; but Lewis has been asked, and as it
		is pleasant to be <em>sure</em> of religious instruction for the servants,
		I came to mention the circumstance, lest you should want your
		<i xml:lang="fr">valet</i>."
	</p>

	<p>
		Now the fact was, that though you know I <em>do</em> say my prayers
		generally, and think the practice a right one, I had not knelt down
		on that morning. The stimulus of a new place, the vexation of the
		preceding evening, and a sort
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
									  of restless curiosity to look about
		me, and make my observations while I had an opportunity of being
		alone; all excited me to quit my room as fast as I could, and I did
		so without a syllable of devotion: behold me, then, again caught in
		the trap; and having blundered out something of being "very happy,
		&amp;c. &amp;c." Frederick led the way, and in a small room where there was
		no appearance of eatables, I found Mrs. Douglas and her daughters.
	</p>

	<p>
		My aunt, who is about forty, is a heavenly looking being, without
		being handsome in the <em>common</em> sense of the word. Her character of
		countenance, manner, dress, is entirely and exclusively <em>her own</em>,
		without conveying in any thing the idea of eccentric. Her smile is
		lovely, and seems to warm into life and serenity whatever it rests
		upon.
	</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<span class="i0">"At length her sorrows drew a line of care</span>
		<span class="i0">Across her brow, and sketch'd her story there.</span>
		<span class="i0">Years of internal suffering dried the stream</span>

	<p>
		The exquisite lines, written by I know not
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
												   whom, from which I
		have made this extract, seem to have been drawn for my aunt. The
		portraiture is perfect; but I must not forget that we are all
		<em>fasting</em>. I was received with "welcome, <em>my</em> Arthur," which I do
		not know <em>why</em>, gave me a lump in my throat&mdash;a mixed sensation
		of pain and pleasure, which I have very seldom experienced. The
		servants, neatly dressed, and decorously arranged, lined the room.
		Fanny placed old Lawrence's cushion, and a psalm, which was read by
		Frederick, was succeeded by a prayer from his mother, pronounced
		with such a thrilling pathos, that I felt it "<em>knock</em> at my heart,"
		as our friend Russell said one day of an Irish melody. I admire
		not only my aunt's selection, but since she <em>must</em> have family
		devotion, her judgment in limiting the time which it occupies to
		so short a period. Nobody seems either tired or inattentive; but
		the petition is so simple, so energetic, and so reasonable in point
		of duration, that really one cannot say much against the practice,
		after all: custom, too, familiarizes one in a day or two to
		kneeling down among
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
							the servants, so that on the whole I have no
		right to complain; and as I shall not describe our <em>genuflections</em>
		again, you may fancy me performing my matins and vespers with
		monastic regularity. The Roman Catholic servants here attend as
		punctually as the Protestants, and of their own free will, as
		my aunt dreads hypocrisy, and therefore deprecates the idea of
		<em>compelling</em> her household to a mere lip-worship; but <em>her</em> prayers
		include all who require divine assistance, of whatever kind; and
		the people seem to feel that she is truth itself.
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, we went to breakfast, and a very nice one it was. The soil
		of this country and its humid atmosphere appear favourable to
		grass, and all the dairy department is much better managed than
		in England, at least as to the excellence of the milk, cream, and
		butter, when brought upon the table; for I do not profess to be
		acquainted, as yet, with the manipulations which they undergo.
	</p>

	<p>
		"My children, have you been fortunate in your ramble this morning?
		What plants have
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
						 you brought me?" asked Mrs. Douglas. I now
		expected a first dissertation upon stamens and pistils&mdash;felt myself
		starching my countenance involuntarily into a most repellent
		expression, and was hastening to swallow a bit of toast that I
		might turn to Frederick while the Linnæan lecture continued, when
		Emily quickly, but joyously answered, "Oh, I am delighted to tell
		you, that we found every thing you want except the club-moss."
	</p>

	<p>
		Much pleased, as well as surprised, I ventured now to hint about
		the botanical books which I had glanced at, adding, "I thought
		that you were all learned in botany as well as the whole circle of
		sciences." A hearty laugh went round the table, and Emily replied,
		"We know a few plants, and it is very amusing to go in search of
		them in our mountain walks."&mdash;"And pray," I asked, "have they not
		all long Latin teeth-breaking names? I dare say you know some
		scientific title for club-moss." "I <em>do</em> know another name," said
		Emily, "but the English is always the easiest
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
													  and pleasantest,
		when one does not want to be precise." "Then, Emmy, we may set
		about our recipe to-day, I think," half whispered little Fan.
		Growing bold, now that I had broken the ice, I proceeded to say,
		"So then you are <em>doctors</em>, too. Upon my word, it is somewhat
		formidable to come into the midst of an academy in this unprepared
		manner. You should all put on wigs, and write treatises; and you
		should inform your friends what course is necessary to be read
		before they come to examination."
	</p>

	<p>
		What answer I should have received to this sally, I cannot tell,
		for in the moment of uttering it, the door opened, and my aunt's
		dear friend, Mr. Otway, made his appearance. The vivid joy with
		which he was greeted was quite unlike any thing that I had ever
		seen, before my acquaintance here; but it was neither noisy nor
		overwhelming, and though certainly very <em>unfashionable</em>, I could
		not for the life of me help feeling how very delightful it must be
		to excite so much lively emotion of a pleasurable kind by one's
		presence. Mr. Otway's presence was welcomed with rapture by the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
		whole group, though in the expression of each <i xml:lang="fr">bien venu</i> there
		was something individually characteristic. My aunt's reception of
		a person for whom she feels affection, is touchingly kind; and
		while the bright glow of hospitality lights up her whole manner
		and appearance, the gleam is accompanied by a sort of tender
		melancholy, which would evidently conceal itself were it possible,
		but which, when interpreted, seems to say, "there <em>was</em> a time when
		you would have been doubly welcome, for then I was not alone."
	</p>

	<p>
		Her smile brings that beautiful image in Ossian to my mind, which
		you and I have admired, "It was like a sun-beam on the dark side
		of a wave." Fanny's exclamation, upon Mr. Otway's entrance, was,
		"Oh, dearest <em>Phil.</em> can this indeed be you?" To expound this
		extraordinary salutation would have been difficult when first I
		heard it; but I am now enabled to say, that this gay assembly
		christened him "The Philosopher," because of his extensive
		knowledge, to which all the family are in the habit of appealing
		as to a great bank of deposit; and it appears, that no letter of
		credit drawn upon
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
						  it has ever been dishonored. <em>Phil.</em> then, is
		short-hand for philosopher, and my ear is now familiar with this
		playful abbreviation.
	</p>

	<p>
		The first effervescence over, I was presented to, and met with
		a cordial shake of the hand by Mr. Otway, to whom I must now
		introduce you. He is about five-and-fifty, tall, and striking in
		his appearance, with a fine forehead, remarkably intelligent eyes,
		and splendid teeth. His manners are easy and polished: and though
		the first <i xml:lang="fr">coup d'[oe]il</i> was a little in the Robinson Crusoe
		style, yet, when he put off a large and shaggy looking cloak, laid
		by a prodigious staff, like that of a watchman, which he held in
		his hand, and got rid of a cap, the laps of which were folded
		over his cheeks when he first came in, I perceived that he was a
		remarkably well-looking man; perhaps I should say <i xml:lang="fr">distingué</i> most
		decidedly, and thereby hangs a tale, for my evil genius was at
		hand, and I got into a scrape on account of him ere an hour elapsed
		after his introduction; but not to anticipate, it seems that a long
		illness had confined him for some time, and this was the first
		visit that he had made on foot,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
										which was the reason of his being
		unusually muffled, and also of the more than common happiness
		expressed at sight of him. He sat only a few minutes, but promised
		to dine on the following day; and immediately after his departure
		my aunt, addressing herself to me, said, "Arthur, my love, we are
		a home-spun set of people here, very unlike the world to which you
		are accustomed, and instead of passing our mornings in amusement,
		we go to our several occupations till two o'clock, at which hour
		you will always find luncheon in the breakfast-parlour, and your
		cousins ready to ride or walk; but as you must not be expected to
		drop all at once into our old-fashioned ways, Frederick and Emily
		shall be your companions to-day, Charlotte and Fanny to-morrow. In
		this manner, you will be acquainted with our walks, and introduced
		to our sunny bowers. When Fred.'s next examinations are over, he
		will be a free man; and in the mean time you will, I know, bear
		with our stupidity."&mdash;So saying, she pressed my hand, and left the
		room, followed by the younger girls.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Shall we walk or ride to-day?" said Emily.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
													"We are your attendant
		knights," answered Frederick, "and wait your decision." "Oh,
		oh!" quoth I, "Sir Charles Grandison upon our hands:" I did not,
		however, say so <em>aloud</em>; I thought it better to feel my way a
		little, and only replied, "Certainly."&mdash;Emily, with perfect ease,
		rejoined, that she thought we might perhaps do both, and, turning
		to her brother, added, "Suppose that we take him first through the
		Glen, then round the coppice to Lisfarne Wood; and after luncheon,
		if Arthur is not tired, we may ride up the mountain, and shew him
		the bay." Matters were arranged in a moment, and forth we sallied,
		Frederick presenting one arm to his sister and the other to me.
		"Pooh! what a piece of ceremony you are," said I. "How so?" eagerly
		asked Emily; "Fred. is so affectionate, that he <em>cannot</em> be formal:
		his heart always serves with him in the place of etiquette, by
		suggesting all that the most genuine politeness could dictate: his
		attentions are not confined to strangers; but, unlike those of cold
		mannerists, are bestowed upon the people whom he loves best."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
		This savoured of a <em>sting</em>, and I felt my colour rising; but in
		a second I found that none could have been designed; indeed, how
		should it, for they knew nothing of my conduct with my sisters, and
		therefore could never have intended a stab in the dark. "Plague
		on these <em>retirements</em>," thought I to myself, "where there is no
		standard for good manners but people's own crude notions of what
		is right and wrong! This ponderous machinery of morals, brought to
		bear upon every trifle, is as difficult to be at ease with, as the
		heavy cross-stitch, long-backed chairs of antiquity which are just
		suited to such <em>buckram</em>, and it is a pity that the furniture at
		Glenalta is not in <em>keeping</em> with these straight-laced puritans who
		are its inhabitants."&mdash;Thoughts are rapid, and these flew over my
		mind so fleetly as not to be fashioned into any sort of utterable
		form, when the gay cheerfulness of my companions dispelled the
		passing cloud, and we took a delightful walk, which was enlivened
		by a great deal of pleasant conversation. We talked of Killarney,
		which they tell me I must visit when I cease to <em>bark</em>. We
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
																		planned
		some boating parties, which, by the bye, will be just the thing,
		and kill two birds with one stone; for the physicians, my mother
		tells me in her last letter, desire me to go upon the water, and
		as I like it excessively I shall have the credit of being a very
		docile patient. They tell me that there are some curious remnants
		of antiquity, which I am to see; and, in short, we cut out work
		enough to occupy some time, which, if I can spin out in this back
		settlement of mankind, <i xml:lang="fr">tant mieux</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, but now for my scrape, and a <em>devil</em> of a one I can tell you
		it was. While we were jogging on as merrily as possible, Fred.
		made a hop, step, and jump into the bottom of a ditch, "Emily,
		what is this?" as he snapped at something growing near the bottom.
		I do believe, answered she, that it is a leaf of the parnassia;
		but to make <em>sure</em>, we will keep it for dear Phil. This unlucky
		Phil. was my stumbling block. "By the bye," I said, "he is a very
		fine looking man of his age," and totally forgetting where I was,
		Old Nick put it into my head to add, "pray, is he one of aunt's
		aspirants?"
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
					If I had fired a pistol at Emily, she could not have
		been more amazed. For a second she stood motionless, and then
		burst into tears. I begged a thousand pardons, and asked how I had
		offended, while Frederick, exactly as if he had been her lover,
		pressed her hand with the most affectionate solicitude, and leading
		his sister towards the bank, we were all seated by a sort of tacit
		consent in a moment. A silence while you could reckon ten, ensued,
		and I felt foolish enough, as well as vexed, at such a <i xml:lang="fr">contre
		tems</i> in the midst of our good humour. Again I mentally cursed
		botanists, philosophers, and <i xml:lang="fr">precieuses</i>, though I must own they
		were not to blame upon the present occasion, when it was my own
		confounded folly in forgetting what a <i xml:lang="fr">Ninette à la Cour</i> I had to
		deal with that produced this vexatious <em>kick up</em>. But while I was
		biting my lip, and thinking what I should say <em>next</em>, Emily brushed
		off her tears, and seizing my hand in the kindest manner, gently
		implored my forgiveness, as if <em>she</em> had been the offender, and
		with as much <i xml:lang="fr">naïveté</i> and tenderness, as if she
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
															  had never read a
		word of Greek or Latin in her life, said with energy, "Arthur, will
		you pardon me. I know that you could never have meant the least
		degree of unkindness; I was very foolish not to recollect in the
		instant when you spoke, that you were only jesting; but I am so
		jealous for my beloved mother, and feel such love and respect for
		her valued friend, that unaccustomed to any other sentiments than
		those of reverence and affection, I was quite unprepared for your
		joke, which I know you will not repeat: say that you forgive me." I
		felt really grateful for this good-natured address, because I had
		certainly distressed her, and I therefore said very sincerely that
		I was sorry for having inadvertently touched a chord that vibrated
		so sensitively, adding, "but you do me only justice in believing
		that nothing was further from my intentions than to wound your
		feelings. I live in a world where such things are said every day
		with impunity, and in fact (if you will not be angry with me for
		<em>explaining</em>) I meant simply to say, that Mr. Otway and my aunt
		seem well suited to each other.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
										She is still a very attractive
		woman, and he seems to feel that she is so. Now dear Emily is not
		this 'the very head and front of mine offending?'" "I will try and
		not again expose myself," said Emily, "by giving way to impulses
		which should be under better control; it is very wrong, as well as
		silly I know, to judge all things and people by the same standard;
		and therefore I ought to have remembered, that the gay circle of
		fashion in which you live, must of necessity be governed both in
		habits and opinions by a rule as different as possible from any
		that guides our simple hearts in the Kerry mountains. Now then,
		here is my bargain,&mdash;I will not be angry any more, and you will
		not draw conclusions, till you are better acquainted at Glenalta.
		When you are, you will not be inclined to repeat the <em>treason</em>; you
		will then see clearly how much you mistake the characters of the
		persons who surround you: when the subject may be more interesting
		than it can be while you are a mere stranger here, I will give you
		a sketch of Mr. Otway's history; till then, you are to be a <i>calm
		observer</i>."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
		All this was said with an air that partook of playful and serious;
		and while it conveyed the most cheerful pardon to me, intimated
		as clearly, that the error I had committed was not a slight one.
		Frederick gave an encouraging look at his sister, and merrily
		turning to me, finished, by saying, "We shall all be intimate by
		and by, and see each other as we really are; till then, we must
		obey our little mistress." Frederick and Emily appear quite devoted
		to one another. We recovered our fracas very speedily; and after
		a walk through some of the most beautiful scenery I ever saw,
		returned home. Just as we were leaving a coppice that joins with
		the shrubbery grounds, a poor woman without shoes or stockings, and
		one of the most grotesque figures I ever beheld, popped upon her
		knees while we were crossing a stream; recollecting suddenly that
		I was now in the island of saints, I expected to hear an <i xml:lang="la">ave</i> at
		least from this poor disciple of St. Patrick; but with uplifted
		hands, streaming eyes, and county of Kerry <em>whine</em>, she invoked the
		"'blessed Virgin' to shower down her best
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
												  gifts on Emily's head"
		"Oh Miss, <i xml:lang="fr">mavourneen</i>, Jem is well again, and going to work; and
		I made bould to come over the mountain with a bit o' fish and a
		little hen for ye." "Eileen, I thank you heartily," said Emily,
		"and am very glad to hear that your husband is better; but where
		are your shoes and stockings?" "Honey, I left 'em at home, a fear
		I'd be wearing 'em out too soon; but the flax you gave me is a'most
		spun, and when I gets the price of it, I'll have another pair of
		stockings, and then, plase God, I'll not come to your honor any
		more bare-footed."
	</p>

	<p>
		How strange is this sort of thing! and yet this creature, scarcely
		human, had a kind of natural grace about her which I believe to
		be the offspring of enthusiasm: she was not at all abashed by my
		presence, but tripped lightly along with us, as if assured that
		she was welcome to Emily, who seemed her principal object, though
		turning to Fred. presently, she exclaimed "Och, then Maisther
		Frederick, how low my poor Jem was the last day that your honor
		comed to see him! sure he called to little Tade,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
														 and tould him to
		bring down the priest, and not tell me, a fear I'd be fretted; and
		sure enough, Father Clancy come to us afore night fall, and said a
		dail over him in gibberish like, that Jem did'nt know a word of;
		why then, ever since, he's growing better every day; God bless
		Father Clancy, and the physicks that I gets from Miss Emly."
	</p>

	<p>
		I was much amused: this was worthy a place in Miss Edgeworth's
		Absentee; but we were now opening a little wicket into the
		shrubbery, and Eileen stopping, told Emily that she would go
		round, it not being fit for "the likes of her to come in front of
		the house." Emily's answer was, "you should come this way my good
		Eileen, if it was the shortest, but you shall go round by those
		trees, because you will get rid of your load directly by doing so,
		and I will go with you to keep Carlo from barking at you." How new
		to me is all this attention to the feelings of mere peasants; and
		yet my mother's family are all zealous reformists, and of course
		talk much of the people. The reason no doubt of all this is to be
		found in the total ignorance of the world
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
												  which prevails here. We
		had now come within a few paces of the verandah, when Fanny, with a
		delighted face, flew up to her brother and me, "Pray do look! the
		warm sunshine of this day is bringing out my <em>grubs</em>, and I shall
		have butterflies before the usual time." "Aye, Fan, said Frederick,
		but you will not prevail on this day's warmth to last, and your
		early butterflies may be killed by frost, if you force them out
		before their time." This was a new idea, and abated Fanny's joy,
		who now ran off to consult her mother and Emily upon this matter of
		importance. I find my obedience to your commands, will involve me
		in quires of paper, so if you do not desire a stationer's bill of
		large amount to be brought in to you, upon your return, you must
		let me <em>skip</em> now and then, after giving you these <em>peeps</em> into
		character.
	</p>

	<p>
		Imagine now a nice luncheon furnished with fine apples that have
		outlived the winter, milk, honey, and sandwiches. Suppose us all
		met, and an arrangement entered upon, for the mountain ride.
		Charlotte, Fanny, Fred. and I, mounted, and my aunt setting out in
		a little
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
				 donkey cart with Emily, upon some of their inventions. We
		took a charming ride, and I certainly feel this air quite a balsam
		in itself. These dear little girls; think of their having prepared
		Iceland moss, and made up the finest stuff you ever tasted for a
		cold, which they have left in my room. At every turn I find some
		mark of kind attention, and all this without fuss, or the slightest
		demand upon my gratitude.
	</p>

	<p>
		Brother and sisters were gay and agreeable during our excursion.
	</p>

	<p>
		Frederick is a very fine fellow, with excellent abilities and noble
		spirits; and in short, what with sunshine, soft air, fine views,
		and good society, I came back to Glenalta in monstrous good humour,
		notwithstanding that I was put in mind of my morning's annoyance
		by the sight of <em>Phil.</em> driving up to the door in a gig just as we
		reached home. The bell rang, (for I do assure you that we do things
		here <i xml:lang="la">secundum artem</i>, and dress for dinner), and we separated
		after greeting Mr. Otway <i xml:lang="fr">en passant</i>. A very good repast, at which
		Eileen's fish made
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
						   a figure, as also some extraordinary sea-kale
		which is a matter of rivalry between the houses of Glenalta and
		Lisfarne, Emily trying one mode of culture and Mr. Otway another,
		came to an end in due season without the least <em>stagnation</em>, such
		as one so often witnesses in the country.
	</p>

	<p>
		Mr. Otway is decidedly a very superior man, his conversation
		displays extensive information, and, what is singular enough,
		though I am given to understand that Killarney is <em>now</em> the limit
		of his excursions from home, there is nothing awkward about him.
		He is accounted by all, except this family, a great oddity, for he
		does not mix in society with the neighbourhood, and is given to
		solitary walks and musing, which people, less cultivated than he
		is, do not understand. He is not an idler however, as they tell me
		that his life is a continued series of active beneficence.
	</p>

	<p>
		When the dessert was put upon the table, and the servants gone,
		we drew our chairs very snugly round a blazing billet, which the
		evenings are just chilly enough still to render as
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
														   comfortable as
		it is a social sight; and just as we had formed a crescent about
		the fire, that sly-boots, little Fan, looking over at me, with the
		most innocent archness imaginable, made an appeal, for which I was
		not quite prepared, and addressing herself to Mr. Otway, suddenly
		asked him, "What is the meaning, dear Phil. of calling people
		Blue-stockings, whose stockings are really white?"
	</p>

	<p>
		Mr. Otway smiled, and answered, "Blue-stockings, my Fan, is a
		vulgar slang for learned ladies."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Why not for learned gentlemen too?" replied Fanny.
	</p>

	<p>
		"That is more than I can tell you, unless for the reason, that
		those who have given this nickname to your sex, are of the other
		themselves, and there are not many men who like ridicule, when it
		is brought home."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Then I am to understand that the appellation Blue Stocking implies
		a taunt."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Certainly, a learned lady is the terror of all ignorant men, and
		to cover their own idleness, or incapacity, they never fail to
		under-value
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
					what they do not possess, particularly if they find
		knowledge and ability in those, whom, <em>as females</em>, they consider
		their inferiors; but you ought to apply to your cousin, who can
		give you the latest <em>edition</em>. I am an old square-toes you know,
		and words change their meaning every day. Howard, <i xml:lang="la">unde derivatur</i>,
		modern Blue-stockings if you please?"
	</p>

	<p>
		I felt a little awkwardly, but answered, "Mr. Stillingfleet,
		I believe, is the origin. At least his Blue-stockings at Mrs.
		Montagu's <i xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> are the only parentage that I have heard of for
		the term, and you have defined it."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Well," said Fanny, "this is odd enough, for it appears that
		a gentleman wore the blue-stockings, which are transferred to
		the ladies; but now Phil. I want to know why learned ladies are
		disliked. I always thought that people were esteemed in proportion
		to their knowledge, if they made a right use of it."
	</p>

	<p>
		"<em>There</em>," answered Mr. Otway, "you have yourself told the whole
		secret; <em>if they make a right use of it</em>. Now it has happened
		that some ladies have made a <em>wrong</em> use of their talents
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
																	   and
		attainments, and thus have drawn reproach upon the whole sex to
		which they appertain."
	</p>

	<p>
		"What <em>is</em> this wrong use which which has been so heavily punished,
		may I enquire," interposed Charlotte, while my aunt, Emily, and
		Frederick, seemed quite delighted with this curious catechism.
	</p>

	<p>
		"The word <em>display</em>, includes the whole charge," said Mr. Otway.
		"Some women have foolishly destroyed the ease of society by an
		unseasonable introduction of their acquirements, and a pedantic
		exhibition of the variety and extent of them in pompous expression,
		unsuited to mixed companies, and uncalled for by the occasion."
	</p>

	<p>
		"But why visit the faults of a few on the whole sisterhood,"
		interrupted Fanny, with eagerness, "Mr. Otway?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Because men are very uncandid in their judgments, and find it
		easier to get rid of a vexation by annihilating the cause, than by
		regulating the effects."
	</p>

	<p>
		Emily here begged to know "whether men
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
											   were never vain-glorious,
		and if they were, why they too were not nicknamed."
	</p>

	<p>
		"In fact," said Mr. Otway, "dunces and fools hate in men, as well
		as women, whatever they cannot understand or appreciate; and the
		terms Bookworm, Philosopher, Quid-nunc, &amp;c. are frequently employed
		to designate persons of superior erudition; but men are simply
		avoided as <em>bores</em>; women are contemned as rivals."
	</p>

	<p>
		At this moment I chanced to look at Fanny, and saw a tear gliding
		down her cheek. In the instant of being observed, she started
		up, and throwing her affectionate arms around Mr. Otway's neck
		exclaimed, "Oh never, never, will I call you Phil. again, which
		is the short name with us for philosopher. Why did you not tell
		me before that it was a term of derision? I love you as our dear
		friend, and I thought it the most delightful thing possible, to
		know so much as you do, and to be so like the Encyclopedia as you
		are."
	</p>

	<p>
		It was not in nature to resist this sally. We all laughed heartily,
		though I saw a responding
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
								  tear glitter in my aunt's eye, and Mr.
		Otway impressing a parental kiss on Fanny's cheek, explained in a
		few words, assuring her that however he might feel undeserving of
		the title which she had bestowed upon him, yet, as being her gift,
		it was so valuable that he would not exchange the appellation of
		<em>Phil.</em> for the most beautiful name in the English language.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fanny's gaiety was immediately restored, and as the conversation
		hit my fancy very much, I was glad that Mr. Otway resumed it by
		saying, "the reason why display of a little learning is not so
		common amongst men as women, is not that they are less subject to
		vanity than the latter, but because <em>their</em> vanity is differently
		directed. Learning being the business of <em>all</em> educated men, there
		is nothing on which to plume themselves in knowing a little Greek,
		Latin, and mathematics. Every school-boy does the same, and it is
		only pre-eminence in these studies which renders a man remarkable.
		Now <em>real</em> knowledge, extensive learning, and powerful intellect,
		of the highest class, preclude boasting for two reasons, first
		because I believe
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
						  that it may be asserted of such minds, that they
		are most sensible to the great truths of religion, which, above all
		monitors with whose influence we are acquainted, inspires genuine
		humility; and secondly, because it is the nature of knowledge to
		render those who have made the greatest progress in its attainment
		most keenly alive to the deficiencies of all human intellect. 'A
		little learning is a dangerous thing,' and flippancy is ever the
		offspring of superficial information."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Now unfortunately some of the female sex having just tasted of
		the Pierian springs, have become stimulated to intoxication,
		without proceeding to the sobering draught recommended by the poet.
		Then, as a woman's education does not <em>usually</em> comprehend either
		classical or scientific literature, a very slight proficiency in
		either will make a great shew, just as a solitary candle will do
		in a dark place; but there are silly people to be found in every
		country as of every age, and <em>both</em> sexes." "Pray then," said
		Emily, "would not the abuse of learning be remedied in a manner
		<em>kind</em> as well as efficient,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
										  by making knowledge fashionable,
		rather than by condemning half the creation to ignorance? If girls
		were <em>generally</em> allowed to acquire more information than it is
		customary to teach them, there would be an end of what you call
		blue-stockings, and women would not boast of a little reading any
		more than they do of drawing or music."
	</p>

	<p>
		"You are perfectly right, Emily," answered Mr. Otway, "the best
		gifts may be abused, and the improper use of any good that
		we possess can never be considered as a sound argument for
		relinquishing it. Neither do men argue in this way when the
		question relates to money, power, rank, or any of those advantages
		which they <em>desire</em> to achieve. Now, my own opinion is, that much
		of the unhappiness of married life, as well as the insipidity of
		mixed society, results from the present style of female education.
		Accomplishments are ornamental, yet they are only the acanthus
		that decorates the pillar, not the pillar itself. The most empty
		mind, the worst regulated temper, may be the portion of a young
		lady who plays and sings like
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
									  a professor, who draws and models,
		who can take casts, and sculpture marble. All these things,
		however pretty, occupy neither the highest nor the best powers of
		the human mind; and, generally speaking, they are pursuits which
		<em>suppose</em> exhibition. There are few who cultivate them on their
		<em>own account</em>; and thousands arrive at excellence in several
		branches of polite education without natural taste, merely to
		attain certain ends, and when they are compassed, the scaffolding
		is thrown aside altogether; the fingers are given a holyday, and
		the unfurnished understanding stands confessed in all its vacuity.
		If the vessel be not valuable from what it contains, it naturally
		follows that the external fashion will determine its estimation;
		and thus a short-lived grace comes to be the pearl of price; and
		when the bloom of youth is past, there is no fund to support the
		long evening of life. A sleepy animalized existence at <em>home</em>, or
		a perpetual search after excitement abroad, succeeds. Both sexes
		degenerate, society grows more vapid, and more vulgar, every day,
		till reduced to its coarse elements of mere
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
													sensual attraction,
		folly ends in vice, and things are worse and worse, till some
		new impetus arises to change the entire system. If companionship
		be the charm of social intercourse, why should not both sexes
		cultivate those qualities and attainments which, besides being most
		intrinsically excellent, promise durability?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Arthur," said my Aunt, "you must represent <em>the world</em>, and reply
		to Mr. Otway." "Well then, with deference to his opinion," said
		I, "let it be remembered that there is no necessary connection
		between the amiable qualities of heart which we admire in woman,
		and book knowledge. On the contrary, I should say that reading is
		a selfish pleasure; shut up in a library, surrounded by grammars
		and lexicons, people are not likely to improve their tempers
		half so much as in the endeavour to please by proficiency in
		music, dancing, drawing, sculpture, and all the list of elegant
		accomplishments which every mother in the fashionable world
		procures with the utmost anxiety for her daughters. In fact, the
		<em>establishment</em> of a girl who has no fortune, absolutely depends
		upon her power of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
						  attraction; and when you reflect that men seek
		society to unbend their thoughts, and to get rid of the studies, as
		well as the cares which oppress them in the several walks of busy
		occupation, whether in the field, or the closet, the senate, or the
		court, I cannot help feeling that matters are very happily adjusted
		in the division of labour, which the general sense of mankind has
		adopted, and that women have no business whatsoever with any thing
		but the <i xml:lang="fr">agrémens</i> of life, and should leave to us the whole toil
		of reading and thinking."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Well I am sure," said Fanny, "the motive is so kind that the
		arrangement <em>ought</em> to be a good one. What do you think, Mamma?"
		"My love," answered her Mother, "I shall lie by and be a listener.
		The argument is in very good hands, and I shall keep my opinion in
		reserve, for a <em>single combat</em> with Arthur, when he is inclined 'to
		fight the battle o'er again.'"
	</p>

	<p>
		"We will take Emily's judgment upon this question," said Mr. Otway:
		"Emily, what think <em>you</em> of the gallantry which Fanny conceives
		to be deserving of such praise?" "Indeed,"
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
												   ingenuously answered
		Emily, "a kind motive, I should say with Fan, is so sweet, that
		it inclines one to find fault with great moderation; but, however
		amiable the desire to save our sex all trouble, I must own that I
		do not at all admire the expedient, nor think that it seems to be a
		judicious one. Reading is a great pleasure to me, and if books were
		denied me, I should feel a void in my life which I do not believe
		it would be easy to fill; besides, the day is so long, if one rises
		early that I do not see why there should not be time for many
		things as well as music and drawing."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Come, come," said Mr. Otway, "it is not generous to profit by the
		simplicity of our panegyrists. If the motive for denying, or, at
		least, <em>grudging</em> to women the advantages of a sound and a literary
		education, be analyzed, I fear that it will turn out but little
		creditable to our sex, and the proof that it is so, may rest on
		the circumstance that the cleverest and really best informed men
		are those who encourage female ambition to soar above the common
		standard. <em>These</em> men delight in superior talents,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
																and cultivation
		wherever they find them. They are not afraid of rivalry, and their
		minds are too large to take pleasure in any supremacy which is
		produced by exclusion. The lazy, and the tyrannical, would fence
		in their privileges, and not permit to women a participation in
		what they choose to call their inherent rights; the former to save
		themselves the trouble of acquiring knowledge, and the latter
		because they would depress and enslave the sex to which they
		would allot no higher calling than that of administering to their
		amusement? Is not this a <em>true bill</em>?" I could not deny that there
		was some force in the statement, but urged the <em>general</em> voice as
		being considered the best criterion of what is good in itself, and
		then advanced the necessity of making some difference between two
		sets of beings destined to such dissimilar offices. "Men are born
		to action. They live in public, they preside in the councils of
		nations; they provide for the families that look up to them for
		protection; they labour in the field with their hands, and in the
		closet with their brains. When the toil of life is suspended,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
																	  they
		desire relaxation, and to be gratified by the charms of beauty,
		grace, sweet music, and good manners."
	</p>

	<p>
		"And these are all compatible with much higher and more dignified
		powers, and purposes," rejoined my antagonist. "Some writer,
		whose name I forget, has said, 'tell me your amusements, and I'll
		tell you what you are.' There is a great deal of wisdom in the
		idea, and it holds good in forming an estimate both of nations
		and individuals. The love of gain, the dread of poverty, desire
		of fame; in short, a thousand motives may, and do, constrain men
		to engage in pursuits which make the <em>business</em> of life. A set
		of shoemakers, or a privy council, merely <em>as such</em>, are brought
		to a level with each other, the one party as tradesmen, the
		other as ministers, and the only difference that we perceive in
		contemplating the <em>body</em>, in either case, resides in the superior
		or inferior skill of the workman or the statesman, compared with
		his fellows; but when the low occupation of the one, or the high
		employment of the other, is brought to its close, and the <em>man</em>
		retires from
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
					  his labours to unbend in the enjoyment of the social
		hour, it is <em>then</em> that we find of what materials he is made."
	</p>

	<p>
		"We will suppose first of the humble artizan, that one takes the
		fruit of his toil to the public-house, where it is spent in company
		with the idle and the vicious; that from thence he proceeds to the
		pugilistic ring, and gambles away the remainder of his earnings,
		while his mind is brutalized by the nature of the sport, and his
		wife and children are left to starve. <em>Here</em> you have no hesitation
		in condemning such an appropriation of time and money; nor do I
		believe that you would find any greater difficulty in bestowing
		your praise upon the industrious father who, gathering his children
		round the evening fire, can participate with the goodly partner
		of his cares in the task of rearing a young family to virtuous
		principles and prudent habits as his best happiness. Trust me, my
		young friend, that in the higher classes of society we may trace
		as much variety of character as in the humbler walks; and vice is
		both as vulgar, and unholy, when varnished over by fashion, as it
		is
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
		   in those situations that present its deformity to view unveiled
		by the gloss of rank and fortune. Why should recreation be found
		only in the inanity of sloth, or the stimulus of dissipation? Is
		such recreation worthy of a rational creature? I do not mean to
		say that music and merriment are not very agreeable, but are these
		less pleasing because they are not the <em>sole</em> resources? Here are
		my dear little nurses, whose kindness during a long and painful
		illness I shall never forget. Do you think that I dreaded poison in
		my cup, because Emily can translate Lucian, and Charlotte is not
		perplexed by a quotation from Virgil?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Pray, pray, dear Phil." exclaimed Fanny, "say nothing about Greek
		and Latin, lest Arthur, adopting the language of fashion, should
		call the peaceable inhabitants of Glenalta, Blue-stockings."
		"Indeed but I will," quoth Phil. "and, as I design to enlist Howard
		as the champion of his cousins, I think it fair to tell him all
		that he will have to defend."
	</p>

	<p>
		Here was a pretty loop-hole for a civil speech, such as I did not
		neglect, but declared my readiness to enter the lists, provided
		that I
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
			   was not to be considered a Don Quixote, prepared cap-à-pé,
		to fight the battles of every distressed <em>Blue</em>, who might chance
		to be attacked by an uncourteous enemy. "But, my good Sir," said
		I, "since we have gone so far in this discussion, let me soberly
		and seriously ask what is the <em>use</em> of learning in a woman? Is
		she handsomer, more lively, more attractive, for having her head
		crammed with strange languages? If I am to be a champion, I must
		begin my service by what may appear perhaps rather ungallant,
		though I hope that the present company will acquit me of any design
		to do otherwise than afford my <em>best</em> service, provided that you
		succeed in converting me from opinions which I have been brought up
		in a belief are founded in nature and good sense."
	</p>

	<p>
		"My dear fellow," replied Mr. Otway, "do not profane the names
		of nature and good sense by identifying the one or the other
		with fashion. I would appeal to your understanding, and if that
		is not convinced of error, I would leave you to the prejudices
		which you have imbibed. Let us then now fairly meet each other.
		You ask,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
				 will women be made more beautiful, more lively, more
		attractive, by being more instructed? Perhaps I may encounter a
		laugh, if I answer yes; first, I always consider intelligence as
		the greatest beautifier of a face, which, if handsome, is lit up
		by an additional ray in every new exercise of the mental powers;
		and if ugly is at least prevented from being stupid by cultivation.
		But this will not satisfy you, because I assume the very thing
		that you deny; so I will ask you, have men <em>a right</em> to consider
		women as objects merely of gratification to their eyes and ears?
		Are not women endowed with sense and feeling; with high powers of
		intellectual energy, and immortal spirits like men? Were these
		gifts, think you, conferred for nothing but to be employed in the
		arts of catching butterflies? No, no&mdash;

		When the nymph is changed into the matron, and the sylphid form of

														   sole support
		on the evanescent perfections of youth, the very nature of which
		is to pass away like a morning dream? Would it not be wiser first
		to consider the human species as formed for a world beyond this,
		in which it is appointed 'to fret our little hour,' and to make a
		vital sense of our <em>ultimate</em> destination, the <i xml:lang="la">primum mobile</i> in
		every scheme of existence? This is the grand, the principal, the
		master-link of all earthly union, because it does not end here, but
		binds the faster as terrestrial things wax nearer to a close. Upon
		this broad base would not rational creatures, who are expressly
		fashioned for each others' society in this world, naturally be
		led to cultivate in common the greatest degree of intellectual
		perfection? Do you believe that the ditinguishing, the ennobling
		boon of reason is granted to <em>both</em> sexes, to be only exercised by
		a very limited number of <em>one</em> sex, and lavished in thoughtless
		waste by all the rest? Never entertain such an idea of the Creator,

		not expect you to become a convert in the twinkling of an eye, but
		I feel as
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
				  if we should one day have you added to our ranks, a
		staunch partisan of better views than those which you have learned
		to advocate."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Before you conclude," said I, "your introductory lecture upon
		<em>Bluism</em>, you must hear my creed, such as I brought it to Glenalta.
		Do not suppose that I think it possible for a society to be held
		together without the bond of religion. Whatever errors I might have
		been inclined to fall into, had I been left to myself, I have a
		friend, and that a youthful one too, who has kept such a <em>watch</em>
		upon my sayings, doings, and thinkings, as to preserve me at least
		from the <em>grosser</em> mistakes to which young men are liable who have
		no Mentor to guide their course. I am thoroughly convinced that
		religion is necessary in every community that aims at being well
		ordered, and that women ought to be considered as peculiarly its
		guardians; they are the nurses of young ideas, the first shoots of
		which are directed by female solicitude, and it would never do to
		have our <em>ladies</em> turn infidels."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Very well," said Mr. Otway, "here are some strong admissions.
		You believe in the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
						   absolute necessity of religion in a well
		constituted state, and you are right; for if all the restraints
		which religion superadds to those arising out of mere moral fitness
		and utility, be quite inadequate to render men virtuous, <i>a
		fortiori</i>, they would not be better for increased latitude to do
		evil."
	</p>

	<p>
		"You <em>next</em> admit that the most valuable of all things here,
		because that which best secures peace on earth and happiness in
		heaven, it is <em>peculiarly</em> the province of the female part of
		creation to protect with care, and distribute with zeal. Here is a
		high trust&mdash;here is a mighty office, and it would naturally follow
		from your acquiescence in reposing such confidence in a certain set
		of people, that you must admit the propriety of rendering them fit
		depositories for the sacred trust by some suitable preparation. Be
		assured, my young friend, that a fashionable education will not
		achieve this end. But you must not mistake me. I do not mean to
		assert that there is any necromancy in learning <em>this</em> language or
		the other. I would only be understood to say that during the early
		years of childhood
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
						   there is time enough for much more than is
		usually taught to girls from five to fifteen; and while the memory
		is retentive, the curiosity fresh, and all the faculties ready for
		action, it is a pity that food for the mind should not be provided
		of a more substantial kind than is generally supplied. In learning
		the dead, we attain the principles of living languages; we become
		able to trace our own mother tongue to its source; we enlarge the
		field of knowledge and of comparison; we search the Scriptures
		with effect, because we are enabled to search them minutely; and
		why should these advantages be denied to one half of the creation?
		Woman's empire is peculiarly to be found in her <em>Home</em>. Whatever
		adds dignity to her dominion, and variety to her pleasures in the
		scene of them, I must ever maintain to be the best safeguard of
		national virtue. Barbarism and excessive refinement are extremes
		of a widely-extended series, and like all other extremes come
		to meet at last. The selfishness of the former, exercises the
		pre-eminence of animal strength in compelling the weaker sex to
		endure the fatigue of cultivating
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
										  the ground, and performing
		every servile occupation, in order that the stronger may enjoy,
		without interruption, the coarse and sensual gratifications which
		constitute their happiness; while the equally selfish, but more
		elegant sons of modern luxury, exert a tyranny not less despotic,
		in reducing the female mind to that dull level best suited to
		their own inglorious apathy and sloth. The matter can never rest
		here. Providence has formed the sexes for each other; and the
		mutual attraction is too powerful to be resisted. To regulate the
		nature of this attraction is all that moral improvement can effect;
		and I see with grief a mighty change in progress. Our young men
		are (I speak not of all) cold, careless, rude, and covetous; our
		youthful females are bred up as if for the stage, and as, with
		all 'the means and appliances to boot,' the opera and the theatre
		will always supply more finished specimens of singing, dancing,
		and acting, than can be found elsewhere. We accordingly see that
		many of our present generation of men are not ashamed of seeking
		the companion of their lives, the wife of their bosoms, and the
		mother of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
				  their future offspring, on the boards of Drury Lane
		or Covent Garden: thus destroying whatever gives sweetness to
		domestic retirement. An actress <em>may</em> possess more worth than many
		of the audience who gaze upon her through their glasses from the
		surrounding boxes, but the charm of modesty can <em>hardly</em> belong to
		her who lives in perpetual exhibition; nor can the woman, whose
		sole profession is the study of fictitious and, generally speaking,
		unamiable characters, be expected to have much time for cultivating
		her own character to the profit of an immortal soul."
	</p>

	<p>
		"But, Sir, you speak of the theatre. Our young women of fashion
		are not players; and supposing that they were, and that we must
		all select our partners in the school of Thespis, would the study
		of Homer and Simonides, of Virgil and Horace, be a remedy for the
		evils of which you complain?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"No, my dear Howard. I attach no magic to these authors. On the
		contrary, there may be an overweening attachment to the ancients,
		and there are still a few scholars of the old
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
													  school who value
		<em>every</em> thing that comes to them in Greek or Latin cloathing,
		and encumber their pages with quotations which have nothing to
		recommend them beyond the mere learning which they exhibit. But,
		returning to our argument, I deny your premises. You assert that
		our young women of fashion are not actresses: I maintain that they
		are."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Aye, 'all the world's a stage,' now-a-days. Nature&mdash;beautiful,
		refreshing Nature&mdash;is dismissed from what is technically called
		'good society.' Too many of our youth of <em>one</em> sex are become
		horse-jockies, and pugilists&mdash;idle at school, dissipated at the
		University, and ignorant of most things, except what contributes
		to animal ease and luxury, they issue from the academic groves
		in full-fledged folly, knowing little indeed of learning, either
		ancient or modern, but well skilled in sauces and French wines.
		They are well read in the last edition of Dr. Kitchener, they are
		connoisseurs in eating and drinking, they can break their heads
		in the fancy ring, and their hearts in a rowing match. But, alas!
		how comparatively small the number of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
											  those who commence the
		business of life well furnished with useful knowledge, learning,
		taste, discretion! with all those qualities in short which ought
		to distinguish man from the inferior creation! How often are we
		disappointed when we cast our eyes around, in this polished age of
		the world, in quest of the materials which are to supply our future
		strength in every department of the State! A youth governed by
		religious principle, his head stored with science and literature,
		while his heart expands to <em>all</em> the social ties of generous
		affection, is the <em>only</em> character to whom the interests of his
		fellow-men may be fearlessly consigned; because he alone feels what
		they truly are: and he only who has learned himself to bow with
		respect to the wisdom of experience, and conform to the discipline
		of moral rule may be trusted to watch over the happiness of others.
		Yet such a being as this is a <i xml:lang="la">rara avis in terris</i>, while the
		degenerate race, which I before described, crowd our streets and
		highways; and hope one day, through the influence of rank, to take
		their seats upon our parliamentary benches, where they will vote
		away our liberties,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
							or relax them to license, just as interest
		guides, or party governs. Believe me, my young friend, 'there is
		something rotten in the state of Denmark;' and in turning our eyes
		towards the other sex, the eye finds nothing on which to rest with
		more complacency, except amongst the few who have sense enough to
		perceive and courage sufficient to resist the tide of fashionable
		folly. In what is called <em>the world</em>, it would seem that there is
		a <i xml:lang="fr">guillotine</i> established, to which every intellectual energy is
		fitted by lopping off every germ that buds beyond the narrow limits
		assigned as the modern standard. The heart is forced to undergo a
		like operation; and all the young affections, timid respect, and
		blushing reserve, which would seem to be the indigenous growth of
		the female mind, are destroyed with as much zeal as the gardener
		employs in restraining the luxuriance of his espaliers. Dressed to
		a common model, both in mind and body, you pass from one automaton
		to another, in a London drawing-room, without being conscious
		that you change your place unless by the variety of glare in the
		colours that surround you. These
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
										 <em>effigies</em> neither see, feel,
		hear, nor understand, except as machines may appear to do. Likings,
		dislikings, looks, words, and actions, all are artificial; and
		natural disposition is only displayed when it is too late to
		regulate its movements. Marriage, like the fifth act of a play,
		brings matters to a conclusion, and our young ladies drive off from
		the theatre to exhibit at home the materials which <em>really</em> compose
		their characters. It may be that vanity, only changing its diet, is
		still fed to repletion; but should circumstances deny what habit
		and education have taught to be the only good, disappointment will
		have its revenge, a hecatomb of domestic victims must expiate the
		crime of all who withhold the accustomed tribute that had been paid
		to the attractions of youth."

		I could not restrain a sigh. The portrait was sketched with
		animation, and the features of it were familiar to me. Our <em>Phil.</em>
		proceeded:
	</p>

	<p>
		"I do not <em>insist</em> upon any of the acquirements which excite
		such general terror. I see no specific for the evils which I
		have prescribed in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Chemistry, Botany, or
		Mathematics.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
					 My only object is to deprecate ridicule, and to
		ask for a little portion of that liberality which even descends
		to <em>cant</em> at the present day, in favour of all women of whatever
		country, who are seeking mental improvement. Let us only have
		an end of nick-names, which terrify the timorous; and, with the
		enlightened policy which is beginning to operate in our financial
		and commercial relations, let us renounce our narrow ideas of
		monopoly, and open the way to a free trade of mind, unincumbered by
		the taxes which retard its progress. Let us look a little higher
		than Mrs. Montagu's formal <i xml:lang="fr">soirées</i>, and the quaint cerulean hosen
		of Mr. Stillingfleet.

		"Oh dear Phil.," exclaimed Fanny, "how delightful it will be, if
		Arthur, under your tuition, ceases to be woman-hater."
	</p>

	<p>
		A burst of merriment at my expense, was the consequence. When I
		protested that nothing could possibly be farther from my character,
		and that I had rather the credit of being a <em>lady's</em> man; her reply
		was, "well it may be so, but if you wish to continue so vile a
		system as Phil. has been describing, you would sacrifice one half
		of the species to indulge the whims of the other."
	</p>

	<p>
		Our little party now broke up; and after a very short interval we
		found ourselves re-assembled in the drawing-room. It was agreed
		upon that Mr. Otway's late illness rendered it imprudent for him
		to risk the effects of evening air; and the whole family who
		seemed actuated by one principle in renouncing <em>self</em>, immediately
		declared their intention to amuse their guest
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
													  and relinquish the
		afternoon's ramble. We passed the evening, I cannot tell you how
		pleasantly. My aunt is a charming person, and I cry <i xml:lang="la">peccavi</i>.
		Though her appearance is singularly striking, and the expression of
		her face quite heavenly, dignity is the natural character of both.
		Gentle as a lamb, there is no weakness about her. The mother shines
		pre-eminently in all her conduct, and after one hour's observation
		of her manners towards Mr. Otway, I felt as ready to contradict
		my own suspicion which had wounded Emily's feelings as she could
		possibly be herself.
	</p>

	<p>
		You and I have often argued the point of second marriages, of which
		I was always the advocate; more, I confess because we see them
		every day in the first circles, than from thinking much upon the
		subject one way or the other; but though I hardly as yet know why,
		it would grieve me, were my aunt to marry again.
	</p>

	<p>
		We had music, chess, and conversation, which never flagged, but
		I cannot detail any more of this day's history. Phil. staid to
		prayers, in which he joined with the appearance
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
														of genuine piety;
		and I retired to my room, shall I own it, in a state of mind very
		new, and by no means disagreeable. I felt excited without delirium,
		such as succeeds the whirl of dissipation in town. My mind seemed
		full, my heart glowed, and a sort of <em>reality</em> appeared connected
		with every thing around me at Glenalta, quite unlike what I have
		ever experienced before. Do you know that I was inclined two
		or three times this evening to turn hermit, and live in Kerry.
		However, the fit will not last. The arrival of a stranger is always
		met with something like a flourish of trumpets, which quickly
		subsides, to say nothing of old Oliphant's return, which will tie a
		log about our necks in a day or two.
	</p>

	<p>
		As you <em>will</em> have exact accounts of all that we say, as well as
		do, I find that I must resume my narrative in another letter. This
		has swelled to an unconscionable bulk. Good night. In my next
		you may expect a description of <i xml:lang="la">Coelebs</i> and his breakfast
		at Lisfarne, whither I must go alone as the cousinhood seemed
		determined

		If this be true, as the old spelling books have it, and as I saw
		confirmed to day, by the authority of a village schoolmaster, who
		had a large class operating upon the above sapient apophthegm,
		which served as a copy in the school, and which I have adopted
		for the heading of my letter instead of an extract from some "old
		play," I may come out at last a goodly example of rosy cheeks, full
		pockets, and well-stored pericranium, for here I am living a life
		worthy of Hygeia herself. I was up at six o'clock this morning, and
		according to an arrangement with Emily, had an hour's walk with her
		before I set out for Lisfarne. When we were retiring last night,
		I heard her whisper to Frederick that she meant to visit "Susan"
		in the morning,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
						and on inquiry, I found that the said Susan is a
		poor woman residing in the mountain, for whom some present had been
		prepared. Now, it occurred to me that before I saw Mr. Otway at
		his own house, and particularly as I was to encounter him <em>alone</em>,
		I should like to hear the sketch of his history, which Emily had
		promised me at a future day, so following her to the foot of the
		stairs, I told her how entirely I repented my error, and requested
		her perfect forgiveness, proposing that she should seal my pardon
		by allowing me to be her mountain beau; and moreover, that she
		should come to our morning's walk prepared to gratify my curiosity.
		My petition was granted; a brilliant sun-rise invited us to perform
		our mutual engagement, and we had not made much way in the rugged
		ascent towards Susan Lambert's wild abode, followed by Paddy, the
		running footman upon such occasions, who trotted after us with a
		large basket, well stuffed with I knew not what, when I reminded
		Emily of her task, and she gave me the narrative, which I shall try
		to convey as briefly as I can of Phil's Life and Character.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
		"Mr. Otway," said Emily, "was the dear friend of my father, and so
		devotedly were they attached to each other, that even at school
		they were always called Pylades and Orestes. At the University
		they lived together; and the same day saw them both embark in the
		same profession. For the character of that loved parent who was
		taken from us, before his children were of an age to appreciate
		his various excellences, his splendid talents, exquisite taste,
		and uncommon attainments, I must refer you to his friend, who, it
		is probable will one day describe your uncle, and tell you that he
		was indeed 'a man whose like we ne'er shall look upon again.' I
		could not hope to do justice to the portrait, and will therefore
		not attempt to draw his resemblance. My father and mother, who
		seemed to have been peculiarly formed for each other, met in early
		life, and became mutually attached, as one might naturally suppose
		that two such gifted beings would be. Pecuniary circumstances alone
		prevented their union; but while their happiness was retarded,
		their affection was tried in the furnace, and came out purified.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
		Mr. Otway was the sole guardian of their secret, and the only
		support of their long deferred hopes. After years of devoted
		constancy, they were rewarded at last by such domestic felicity
		as I have heard from Mr. Otway falls to the lot of very few on
		earth, and was too perfect for continuance in a world designed by
		its Great Creator to serve only as a vestibule to more abiding
		mansions. The friends were separated by the tide of events,
		but never ceased to correspond. Once, and I believe but once,
		imagining that he had found a resemblance of my mother, Mr. Otway's
		affections were engaged, and he resigned himself to the fascination
		of such an attachment as only minds of lofty pitch are capable of
		feeling at once noble, disinterested, and devoted. The lady whom he
		loved was rich, while, he at <em>that</em> time, was a younger brother,
		and but slenderly provided for. The dread of being suspected of
		mercenary motives, sealed his lips; and a man of fortune making his
		appearance, the object of his thoughts proved how little worthy she
		was of such a being, by marrying this more opulent
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
														   suitor after a
		very short acquaintance. So dreadful was the shock which our dear
		friend's sensitive nature sustained upon this unexpected event,
		that his life nearly fell a sacrifice to the conflicts which he
		endured. My father and mother were now his staff and solace in the
		hour of trial; and their tender solicitude, aided by time, restored
		to comparative peace that generous spirit which had nearly sunk
		under the pressure of disappointment. He travelled, and ere the
		expiration of many years, was recalled to England, by the death of
		his elder brother, which event was followed at no great distance
		of time by that of Mr. Stanhope, the husband of her who had so
		cruelly trifled with his happiness. Mrs. Stanhope was the mother
		of an only child, and the noble character of our friend overcoming
		every selfish retrospect, cast off the memory of past wrongs, and
		he stepped forward to offer the aid of his best services to the
		widow and the orphan, without, however, I believe, even for a
		moment, entertaining the remotest idea of renewing his suit. His
		lot had been cast; he had retired from what is called
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
															  the world,
		and though so far from becoming a misanthrope that all his fine
		qualities appeared to expand when he obtained the means of making
		others happy; yet he never seemed to calculate upon any change
		in his own situation. Though delicacy and feeling prevented him
		from ever uttering a harsh sentiment, his friends were of opinion
		that he had arrived at a full conviction of having misplaced his
		affections in early life; and that conviction once attained, he
		never sought to hazard a new experiment.
	</p>

	<p>
		But the care of young Stanhope became a favourite object, and no
		assistance which the most efficient friendship could bestow was
		withheld from the boy's mother. Lisfarne was part of the property
		which devolved to this invaluable neighbour of ours by his
		brother's bequest; and the retired beauty of the scenery determined
		him to make this his asylum. His next object was to induce the
		beloved companions of youth, who had shared the gladness of his
		brightest, and dispelled the clouds of his darkest days, to come
		and live in his immediate vicinity. He purchased Glenalta for my
		father,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
				and by his good taste and activity, transformed its rude
		wilds into the little paradise which you see. Here resided the
		happiest family which, I believe, ever existed; but I cannot talk
		of home, I must proceed with the story which I promised you:&mdash;Mr.
		Otway received a letter from a Solicitor in London, to say that
		the interests of his young ward (not that he was <em>legally</em> so)
		required his immediate attendance in town. It was to him a most
		disagreeable undertaking. A recluse through long habit, and devoted
		to the society of Glenalta; active in the discharge of such
		multiplied duties at Lisfarne, as could ill spare his vigilant eye
		and beneficent heart, it was great pain to set out upon a journey
		without understanding its object, and plunge anew into scenes which
		he had abjured in idea for ever. But dear Phil. only hesitates till
		he has satisfied himself concerning what is right to be done, and
		there is no farther pause&mdash;he proceeds to execution. To London he
		went, and never shall I forget how much we longed for his return;
		and what blazing fires of heath <em>telegraphed</em> his approach upon our
		neighbouring
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
					 hills. On reaching town, he only waited to refresh
		himself before he set forward to the Solicitor's, from whom his
		summons had issued, and the mystery was soon unravelled. Mrs.
		Stanhope had married a young fortune-hunter, and was endeavouring
		to prevail upon her son, then a child of fourteen, to make a
		settlement on his pennyless stepfather. Relying on the influence of
		her former attractions, she had prepared a <em>scene</em>, and desiring
		her Attorney carefully to abstain from giving Mr. Otway the least
		intimation of her new tie, she burst upon him in the moment of
		his entrance at Mr. Scriven's house, dressed in fashionable
		attire, which had succeeded in all the gay colouring of a London
		milliner's shop, to the garb of sorrow in which he had seen her
		arrayed in <em>one</em> personal interview after her husband's death. The
		only time of their meeting had been upon that occasion, when he
		begged permission to consider himself as guardian to her child,
		thus proving that, though he had ceased to <em>love</em>, he still felt
		the kindest and most sacred interest in her fate. Disgusted now
		beyond
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
			   the power of controlling his feelings, he put a speedy
		termination to a conference, the manner, as well as the matter
		of which had excited his utmost indignation; and assuring her
		that if any undue advantage was taken by her influence over the
		minor, a suit should be immediately commenced against her and her
		husband, he took a hasty leave. Frightened by these menaces, the
		lady retired, and soon announced her departure to the Continent,
		where, about two years ago, she died of a broken heart. Mr. Otway's
		business completed, he quickly returned to his favourite retreat,
		and loved to wander alone along the beach which surrounds a part of
		his demesne. My dear father once caught him upon a rocky promontory
		with pencil and paper in his hand. The question of 'what is that?
		Has Otway secrets with <em>me</em>?' was answered by 'it is a worthless
		scrap; take it, but Henry touch not that chord again&mdash;it jars upon
		my ear, and spoils all harmony.' I will now read you the lines
		which my father obtained by this surprise. It is the only poetry
		which even mamma has ever seen of her friend's
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
													   writing.&mdash;Here
		Emily read to me the following stanzas:&mdash;

		"These lines," continued Emily, "first taught my parents the nature
		and extent of those feelings which had outlived the blights of
		early hope. They appear to prove that, however shipwrecked had
		been his own happiness, Mr. Otway had respected a perfect freedom
		of choice, and, though Mr. Stanhope differed widely from him,
		he had tutored his unselfish soul to consider this rival as the
		successful candidate in an election, the honourable fairness of
		which he had no right to question. It would seem that, in the
		depth of his heart, Mrs. Stanhope's pardon had been sealed, and
		when the death of her husband released her from her first vows,
		a romantic mixture of affection, which borrowed a reflected glow
		from the memory of brighter days, and that high and delicate
		respect
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
				of which the most refined and exalted minds alone are
		capable, spread round the consecrated image a mantle of fond
		protective kindness, akin perhaps to love, as pity is said to be,
		but so beautifully tempered, that it would never have passed the
		sacred boundary of friendship pure as angels might have breathed.
		The unseen bonds which had silently preserved connection between
		our friend and a woman whom I can never believe to have been at any
		time deserving such attachment as he bestowed, was rudely severed
		by Mrs. Stanhope's late conduct; and, for some time, the impression
		which such levity as was discovered in her second ill-assorted
		marriage made upon a mind almost morbidly sensitive, threatened to
		impair the benevolence of a character formed to shed on all around
		an atmosphere of happiness; but a strong sense of religion, which
		is the pole-star of his every action, gained its second victory;
		and time gave him back, once more unshorn of his beams, to be the
		life and animation of that little society who enjoy the blessing of
		his presence. I must hurry you through the remaining part of my
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
		<i xml:lang="fr">memoir</i>, not only because we are arriving at Susan's cabin, but
		also because it is so interwoven with the sorrows of Glenalta, that
		I fear to trust myself with a theme too fresh in recollection to
		bear the light; suffice it to say, that Heaven has given us such a
		friend in Mr. Otway, as no measure of gratitude can ever repay."
	</p>

	<p>
		Emily paused, and I expressed my warm interest in her narrative,
		and thankfulness for the eloquent sketch which she had thrown off;
		but as my evil genius never even <em>dozes</em> in the county of Kerry,
		what should I unfortunately add, but "Phil. indeed is a treasure,
		and I rejoice for you all in such a tower of strength as his
		friendship affords to my aunt and her family. Frederick too is, I
		dare say, his object, and will inherit his possessions."
	</p>

	<p>
		Emily blushed scarlet; her eyes were instantly suffused with
		tears, and she seemed ready to choke; but, recovering herself in
		an instant, with a little effort she said, "Arthur, I <em>will</em> not
		attribute any thing of this sort to motives unworthy of you; I am
		determined to set down to
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
								  the mode of your own education whatever
		may appear like want of feeling. You are mistaken in your surmises;
		but, while it pleases God to continue to us the happiness which we
		now enjoy, let us not embitter life by dreadful anticipations."
	</p>

	<p>
		We reached the hut to which we were bound, and I had no time for
		reply: I could only remark, in my own mind, on the difficulty of
		accommodating the ways of the world to the peculiarities of these
		simple folks; yet, at the same time, no doubt it is a pleasanter
		sensation to be "<i xml:lang="fr">Alcibiade ou le Moi</i>," rather than cherished for
		the sake of one's money.&mdash;On entering the cabin, alias cottage, we
		found a boy of about twelve years old nursing a weeping infant,
		and vainly endeavouring with one hand to scrape together a few
		expiring embers, while a poor woman, apparently in the extremity
		of weakness, lay in a corner, upon a miserable bed. "Susan, how do
		you do?" was answered faintly by, "very ill, dear miss." "Where is
		Nancy?" "Gone to the fair to buy a bit of flannel for the child,
		and her father is gone with her to sell our <em>slip</em> of a pig."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
		"Arthur," said Emily, throwing off shawl and bonnet in an instant,
		"here is work to be done, and we must not be idle. You have taken
		Frederick's place this morning, and will kindly, I am sure, perform
		his duty: fly and bring me a good bundle of dry heath, or any
		thing else that you can find of which we can make a fire. Paddy,
		bring me a pitcher of water directly; and you, Tommy, give me
		your little sister, and settle the turf in a moment." So saying,
		she took the child, and soon set the poor thing at rest with some
		milk, which the basket contained, while I, glad to make the <i xml:lang="fr">amende
		honorable</i> by my alacrity, went off as if quicksilver were in my
		heels, to rummage up whatever combustible the mountain afforded.
		I was successful, and got credit for my speed. You never saw any
		thing like the magic of Emily's operations: as if she had been
		a peasant born, she broke up the sticks which I had gathered,
		and, blowing with her breath, for the cabin was unfurnished with
		bellows, she had a blazing fire in five minutes. Then, with a
		neatness and dexterity which would have done honor to a Welch
		inn,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
			 she washed an old sauce-pan, and put some meal into it to
		make gruel; hushed the baby to sleep, and, after laying it by the
		poor mother, and giving the latter a little weak wine and water,
		she desired Paddy to remain and stir the gruel till her return;
		then, taking my arm, hurried down the hill, and crossing a field
		which we had not come through before, tripped lightly up to a
		half-ruined gate, which was fastened by a twig to an old post, and
		disengaging this rustic band, lifted the frame, and we were in the
		adjoining space before I perceived that my fair cousin, to avoid
		interrupting our conversation, had performed the office of pioneer,
		which, according to all the laws of chivalry, should have fallen
		to my portion. I was going to apologize, when Emily pointed to a
		path, and turning into another herself, bid me fly, or I should be
		late at Lisfarne. We shook hands, and separated; and as I walked
		on alone, I could not help moralizing on the novelties which daily
		present themselves to my view. Lighting a fire, boiling gruel,
		sweeping up a cabin-hearth, and singing lullaby to a squalid infant
		in a dirty
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
				   dress; and all this done and executed as if custom had
		rendered the whole business perfectly familiar, by a young lady of
		family and education; a scholar too, well read in Greek, Latin,
		Italian, French,&mdash;skilled in botany, chemistry, and I know not how
		much more; in short, a <em>Blue</em> to all intents and purposes. It is
		certainly neither more nor less than an anomaly which as yet I am
		unable to account for.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Douglas girls are totally divested of affectation. Whatever
		they say or do, is said and done without the slightest reference to
		<em>effect</em> farther than this, that the best tact seems to regulate
		every word and action. The desire to impart pleasure makes them
		sure to please, and the dread of giving pain must, I think, render
		it impossible that they should wound one's feelings. Beyond this
		limit my cousins know no art. I fancy that I see a half-suppressed
		smile curling on your lip, as you exclaim, <em>mentally</em> at least,
		"What a revolution! Why here is Howard talking sense like a doctor
		of the <i xml:lang="fr">Sorbonne</i>!"
	</p>

	<p>
		I confess to some very sober thoughts as I jogged on to Lisfarne;
		but as I was alone, I had
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
								  nothing else to do except to muse and
		moralize; however, no triumph. I enter a caveat against any manner
		of rejoicing. I have not read my recantation, having a just dread
		of hasty judgments, and also of old Oliphant: he is the Mordecai
		sitting in my gate, and another week at Glenalta may bring out a
		very different story.
	</p>

	<p>
		In four-and-twenty hours Kill-joy will have arrived, and then comes
		Sunday, as if at one blow to crush one's spirits to annihilation.
	</p>

	<p>
		These were my lucubrations <i xml:lang="fr">en chemin faisant</i>, and just as I
		reached the hall-door at Lisfarne, the nine-o'clock bell ushered
		me in with <i xml:lang="fr">eclat</i>, though as little <em>hinging</em> upon my <i xml:lang="fr">entrée</i>,
		as the thunder and lightning which happened to synchronise with
		the poor Jew's carousal over a pork steak at Genoa. I was met
		at the threshold by Mr. Otway, who smiled a delightful welcome,
		and, taking me by both hands, accosted me with, "My dear Howard,
		I am heartily glad to see you at Lisfarne, and not the less so,
		because you are <em>punctual</em>. You should have had your breakfast
		at <em>any</em> hour; but I love to see young people recollective." I
		did not think it exactly
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
								 <em>honest</em> to appropriate this compliment
		of the old school to myself, as I certainly never deserved it in
		all my life, and therefore expressed my happiness at not having
		kept him waiting; but <em>handed</em> over to Emily the whole merit of
		Cindarillaship in this my first visit at Lisfarne.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Emily is a charming creature," answered mine host, "but that
		is nothing wonderful at Glenalta, where such a mother presides.
		Howard, you have the good fortune to reckon amongst your nearest
		relations, a little group whose virtues would save the universe
		from destruction, were the divine vengeance to over-take a guilty
		world, as in days of yore.&mdash;How do you like your aunt and cousin?"
		"Extremely, were I to judge by what I have seen; but we are new to
		each other, and they are very kind in excusing all the blunders
		which a man wholly unused to retirement is liable to make in a
		circle where a much higher standard of moral feeling prevails than
		that which governs what we call 'the world.'"
	</p>

	<p>
		Mr. Otway looked benignly at me, saying, "Come, we must not get
		into a discussion now;
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
							   you deserve your breakfast, and shall not
		be interrupted." And a capital breakfast we had.
	</p>

	<p>
		A beautiful Newfoundland dog lay at his master's feet; a fine
		tortoise-shell cat purred upon the back of his arm-chair; and the
		windows were presently assailed by an army of supplicants in the
		shape of the finest pea-fowls that I ever saw.
	</p>

	<p>
		"See what it is, Arthur, to be an old batchelor! I am obliged to
		keep my affections from becoming stagnant, you find, by practising
		them upon all these birds and beasts which you perceive are my
		companions as well as pensioners." After feeding the numerous
		host, we sallied from the breakfast-parlour, and Phil. escorted me
		to his study, a most comfortable apartment, and well lined with
		books. He has a beautiful collection of the classics, all the best
		modern works of science, and a rich assortment of history and
		<i xml:lang="fr">Belles Lettres</i>. While I was glancing over this, he pointed to
		a compartment in the far end of the room, desiring me to examine
		its contents. "There I keep my novels, reviews, and magazines; for
		you know, that 'all work
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
								 and no play would make Jack a dull boy;'
		and as I suppose that you do not intend to read yourself into a
		consumption while you stay at Glenalta, I give you a letter of
		credit on whatever amusement these shelves can supply." In this
		Poets' Corner I found Scott's works, both in prose and verse;
		several other modern novels of good name; and all the early poems
		of Lord Byron. "I perceive," said I, "Mr. Otway, that you have
		not yet completed your set of Byron's works; you have not got Don
		Juan, nor&mdash;" "Nor never shall, my young friend," answered the sage
		of Lisfarne. "I cannot prevent people who have money to buy and
		inclination to peruse, from reading these works; but they shall
		not find them in <em>my</em> library." "Then, sir, you are, I presume, of
		opinion that one cannot separate the poison from the poetry, and
		avoid imbibing the one, while we enjoy the exquisite beauty of the
		other."
	</p>

	<p>
		"No, my dear boy; these are idle notions. Wherever vice is an
		ingredient in any compound so mingled as to seize upon the
		passions, or delight the imagination, the draught will always
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
																	  be
		injurious more or less. Even those minds of finer mould than we
		commonly meet with, will not escape, though they hate the contact,
		they cannot shun its defilement; and that which is impure, must
		sully whatever it touches." "Well, I should have supposed that good
		taste would protect a man of refined education. In fact, such a
		man rejects whatever is coarse, and simply vicious: he reads Lord
		Byron, not <em>because</em> of his occasional deviations from religion and
		morality; but in <em>spite</em> of them he admires the splendid genius who
		of all modern writers best understands, if I may so express myself,
		the metaphysics of the human heart, while every man of feeling must
		lament the shipwreck of such talents. The broad-cast pollution
		which is necessary to season a mess for vulgar palates, <em>must</em>
		be pernicious in the highest degree; but I confess I have never
		felt in the same way of those <em>polished</em> compositions which are
		only read by people of superior attainment, and who are fortified
		against evil by knowledge of the world."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Alas, Howard, these are nice distinctions,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
													and lead but to
		delusion. Our morals are much like a taper lit at each extremity,
		they are consuming at both ends. You talk of coarse messes,
		seasoned to the taste of vulgar appetite: believe me, it is a
		melancholy fact, that there are cooks who undertake to cater
		for nicer stomachs, and who know how to insinuate their poisons
		with such skill as to secure the custom of all who are not proof
		against their temptation. That number, I fear, is small; and as to
		the difference between vice well and ill dressed, you will find
		that it is about the same with that which distinguishes Tilburina
		stark mad in white satin, from her confidante stark mad in white
		linen. Amongst the mal-contents of the present day, you hear the
		complaint continually repeated, that there is one law for the rich,
		and another for the poor: the charge is unfounded, and, generally
		speaking, <em>known</em> to be so by the men who bring it forward. It
		will neither do to have two sets of laws, nor of <em>morals</em>, in any
		country. The tendency of all ranks in the community is to imitate
		those who are placed above them; and this aspiring inclination is
		to be
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
			  traced from the lowest grade in society, till having reached
		the throne, you can rise no higher. The self-same rule applies to
		religion. I was glad to hear you say yesterday at Glenalta that
		you felt the absolute necessity of its influence in a state for
		the preservation of order and virtue; and that you considered
		women as the natural guardians of its altars. This is all right;
		but you are egregiously mistaken if you suppose that women will,
		generally speaking, take pains to nurture and cherish what is
		despised by the other sex. There are a few, and very few, such
		beings as your aunt, who appear to have dropped into our planet
		from some happier sphere, and who adjust their principles of action
		to a model of abstract perfection, with which common-place mortals
		are unacquainted. Such beings only think of how to please God; but
		the mass of men and women dress themselves daily in the mirror of
		each other's approbation, and act reciprocally on each others'
		characters. Let one sex degenerate, it matters not which, you will
		find the other follow in the downward course."

		"But, my dear sir, these authors whom you decry, do not <em>create</em>
		vice, they only <em>exhibit</em> it; and though I do not advocate the
		practice, yet after all it would seem that men need not be
		much worse for <em>reading</em>, than for hearing and seeing what is
		exceptionable. If infidelity and immorality were only propagated
		by books, your argument against such writers as Lord Byron would
		be unanswerable. But allow me to say, that the Bible itself,
		in the strongest terms, insists on the depravity of the human
		species, and offers the most flagrant illustrations in proof of
		human delinquency. The hardness of heart, and unbelief of man,
		are frequently held up to view in Holy Writ; and what does a
		Rochefaucauld in prose, or a Byron in verse, do more than represent
		things as they <em>are</em>?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"If you consider the matter for a moment," replied my opponent,
		"I fancy that you will be at no loss to discover some striking
		differences which will sufficiently answer your question. The
		evil tendency of such writers as Rochefaucauld, and all the class
		of satirists, who represent man as a debased and hypocritical
		animal,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
				does not proceed from the truth of the picture, but from
		the manner of the painter. The scriptures indulge us in no 'lying
		vanities;' they speak of the human race as born in sin and the
		children of wrath; and Conscience, when we attend to her voice,
		confirms the humiliating charge, with uncompromising fidelity. But
		while the Bible, and those who preach its doctrines, point out the
		disease, they likewise present the antidote. If they proclaim the
		deformity of the natural man, it is to shew how the crooked may
		be made straight; if they expose his weakness, it is to impart
		strength; if they display his corruption, it is but to invite him
		to wash in those waters which cleanse from all impurity. But such
		moralists as you support, if moralists they can be called without
		absurdity, would seem intent on excusing vice. The effect of their
		books is, as it were to <em>legalize</em> iniquity, by representing it as
		invincible, and to destroy all sense of shame by laying bare its
		concealments. Whatever produces this result by means of a pungent
		and sententious brevity, is doubly injurious; for the authority of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
		a maxim is thus combined with the stimulus of evil: the form
		is thus rendered portable and adhesive; and truths conveyed in
		an epigrammatic shape at once flattering to our sagacity in an
		appeal to its accuteness, and soothing to our faults by pronouncing
		them to be universal, are not likely to be viewed as subjects for
		serious lamentation; and the danger is, that the generality of men
		will contemplate the moral sketches with feelings similar to those
		commonly inspired by a spirited cariacature; namely, a desire that
		the object of ridicule may continue to exist, rather than not be so
		strikingly pourtrayed. As to Lord Byron, who stands pre-eminent,
		like Milton's Satan, at the head of all the mischief-workers of the
		present time, his poison is of another kind: slow and penetrating,
		it is inhaled in the breeze, and absorbed into the circulation; its
		effects are of the morbid class; it seduces, it insinuates, and,
		like opium too freely used, destroys every healthful function of
		the mind, and substitutes the distempered energy of an over-wrought
		imagination for the wholesome exercise of reason and the sweet
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
		charities of the heart. His beautiful poetry, and an inexhaustible
		source of talents, rare as they were brilliant, operate as
		cords which draw all mankind after him in bonds of submission.
		Descriptions of nature or character, external to ourselves, however
		happy in their delineation, interest but feebly in comparison with
		what you justly call the '<em>metaphysics</em>' of sentiment. This is the
		most fascinating of all possible studies; it requires no labour,
		it asks no preparation; and all people, whatever their pretensions
		in other respects, conceive themselves qualified for the school
		of mental analysis which Byron has instituted and endowed. A
		bad husband, a bad son, a bad father, has but to retire to some
		'rose-leaf couch, where, nursing his dainty loves and slothful
		sympathies,' he may find, in a volume of this too-attractive bard,
		an apology for every sin of temper, every violation of duty; nay,
		so contagious is the influence of this Byron-mania, that our young
		men <em>cultivate</em> the failings of their chief, and seem to fancy that
		in becoming imitators of Childe Harold's eccentricities, they
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
		may slide into his unrivalled genius. Selfishness and egotism are to
		be found in the fallows of many a mind; but where are our youth to
		learn Lord Byron's recipe for compounding them?"
	</p>

	<p>
		Though not convinced, I was excited, and ventured again into the
		field, by asking Mr. Otway whether good does not grow out of evil?
		"Surely," said I, "Truth, like a lazy corporation, would rely upon
		its charter, and have nothing to do but fatten on its revenues,
		were it not for opposition.

		"The publication of wrong principles stirs up our slumbering

		"The mind of man is easily corrupted, and clings with tenacity to

																	 we

		covering, but death and destruction are its inmates: rank and
		wealth confer no privilege, and afford no amulet to preserve from
		the contamination of immorality, alike fatal in its effects to high
		and low&mdash;rich and poor; but though I would guard you from giving
		yourself up to such a pilot through Parnassus as Lord Byron, I love
		poetry too well myself to withhold its enjoyment from my young
		friends. I am an old bachelor, but I hope that you will not find
		me a severe ascetic; all things in their season&mdash;buds in spring,
		blossoms in summer, and the fruit to crown our autumn board.
		Youth is the natural period in which Hope and Fancy delight to
		weave their golden tissues, and life is too changeful a scene to
		make it necessary that we should voluntarily abridge its harmless
		gratifications. We must not, however, sit here all day, while
		such a brilliant
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
						 sun is inviting us to walk; I have a great deal
		to shew you, and we shall have many opportunities, I hope, for
		conversation."
	</p>

	<p>
		We were soon in the fields. After seeing a great deal of well-kept
		and tastefully disposed pleasure-ground immediately contiguous
		to the house, excellent kitchen garden, and admirable farm-yard,
		stables, &amp;c. we visited an inclosure, called here the <em>paddock</em>,
		where were at least a dozen old horses, which were turned to graze
		as superannuated pensioners. "When any of these my old and faithful
		servants," said Phil., "can enjoy life no longer, I have him
		despatched by a friendly bullet." "But, sir, you might get money
		for these; they do not seem by any means past their labour." "Not
		<em>quite</em>, perhaps, but they have worked diligently, and shall now
		have a holyday while they live." From the paddock we proceeded to a
		line of neat cottages, furnished each with a strip of garden at the
		back, and ornamented in front by a little rustic paling, thickened
		into a fence impervious to pigs and dogs, by privet, sweet brier,
		and roses. "Here are some of your
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
										  tenants' houses, Mr. Otway, I
		suppose." "Why not exactly tenants in the <em>usual</em> sense: these are
		poor people, who, like my old horses, have seen their best days in
		my service, and it is fair that <em>they</em> too should rest from their
		labours."
	</p>

	<p>
		Showers of blessings were shed from these humble dwellings as
		we passed along, which were repaid by kind greetings from their
		benefactor. With one poor soul who sat in an arm-chair made of
		straw at her door, and who was blind, the good Phil. shook hands,
		and said aloud, "Mr. Howard, this is Kate Sullivan, the Queen of
		<em>Pastime Row</em>, which is the name given by your cousin Fanny to
		this line of houses." Old Kate appeared to feel as much delighted
		by this distinguishing compliment, as an autocrat of the proudest
		empire could be in seeing all the nations of the earth paying
		homage to his supremacy.
	</p>

	<p>
		"God bless Miss Fanny, and all the misses of the Glynn," cried old
		<em>Cathleen</em>; "they are the Lord's own children; and glory, honour,
		and praise be to his holy name; he will make a wide gap for 'em
		whenever they are going
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
								into heaven; and <em>Maaster</em> Arthur, my
		heart (for 'tis I that very well has a right to know that you're
		he, and nobody else), if his honour would'nt be after telling you
		the <em>maining</em> of Miss Fanny's <em>concait</em>, why, sir, 'tis, that she's
		a pleasant, funny craiture in herself, and she have a <em>double aim</em>
		in <em>wording</em> the houses; for <em>pastime</em> they say is all as one as
		games, and sport-like; and it <em>mains</em> too, that (God be praised for
		all things) <em>we</em> are going down the hill, as I may say, and past
		our time for being any good-for."
	</p>

	<p>
		I charmed this old soul as much by laughing heartily, and entering
		with spirit into Fanny's humour, as if I had presented her with
		fifty pounds. She called an aged man from the next door to hobble
		out and join in the merriment, which I dare say ran before it
		stopped, like an electric stream through every conductor of the
		whole series. As we walked on, "I perceive," said I, "that her
		majesty of <em>pastime</em>, is a Protestant, by her assurance that my
		cousins are all travelling the high road to heaven." "You are
		mistaken my dear fellow,&mdash;Kate has an <i xml:lang="la">ave</i> for every bead in her
		<i xml:lang="ga">paddreen</i>, which is the Hibernian
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
												version of Corona, or Coronach;
		and blind as she is, is conveyed by one of my paddock horses
		annually on the eve of St. John, to a holy well, not far distant
		from Lisfarne. This little journey is all the work that the queen
		and her cattle are able to accomplish; and the same beast, that
		'roan barbary' which came up to welcome us at the gate, has drawn
		Kate and her truckle for so many years, that were True-penny to
		die, I believe that blind as is his mistress, she would find out
		that she had lost him, and be uneasy till the priest was sent for,
		to <i xml:lang="ga">shrive</i> and anoint her, in the full persuasion that <em>her</em> hour
		was also come."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Well, you really do surprise me, but to confess the truth, you
		deal in nothing but miracles in this county of Kerry. In less
		than a week I have seen some strange things, which had any one
		presumed, ere I beheld them, to say were existing realities, I
		should have laughed as the king of Pegu is said to have done when
		he heard of nations being governed without a monarch. I have seen
		<em>Blue-stockings</em> without pedantry, refinement that has never
		been learned
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
					 in the world of fashion, religion free from cant,
		retirement unaccompanied by <i xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>; and now, as my list goes on
		increasing like the story of the house that Jack built, here is the
		Roman Catholic creed divested of bigotry; in the shape of an old
		woman too, who fully expects, though a Papist herself, to meet a
		Protestant family in the skies."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Aye, my boy, and I hope that you will soon cease to wonder at
		any of these things. The poor people of this island are brim-full
		of intelligence and feeling; qualities which are of <em>adjective</em>
		character, and increase the measure of good or bad exactly as they
		happen to be associated. Were our peasantry fairly dealt with, the
		tables would speedily be turned, and instead of that cold-hearted
		sarcasm which would seem to be 'the badge and sufferance of all
		their kind,' you would see their accusers glad to steal away, and
		hide their diminished heads."
	</p>

	<p>
		"But, sir, this is peculiarly the age of reason, and you will soon
		be able to bring your assertion to the proof. All the world is mad
		now upon the subject of education, and I suppose
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
														 the light of
		modern liberality, which scorns the narrow principle of a churlish
		exclusion, has with the eagle eye of truth, borne down and pierced
		the shades of prejudice that may have hung upon your sea-girt Isle.
		Have you not schools at Lisfarne, and Glenalta? and if you will let
		me ask one question allied to the last, <em>may</em> I venture to enquire
		why you, whom I should imagine of all men, the last to countenance
		ignorance and superstition, should abet them both by sending old
		Kate upon her pilgrimage of folly, instead of endeavouring to
		open her mind to the sun of knowledge?" Otway smiled, and taking
		me by the hand, jocosely said, "why, Arthur, thou art fit for a
		senator; we must have you in the House of Commons; you are an
		orator:" then, resuming his usual expression of features, "you
		will despise me perhaps," added he, "if I tell you that I am not
		bitten with the fashionable school mania to the extent which you
		deem requisite to constitute a <em>liberal</em>. I have two schools,&mdash;one
		of them, and by far the most numerously attended, is for works of
		industry exclusively.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
							  To the other I only admit such children
		as by a previous discipline in moral conduct, and regularity
		of demeanor, earn the reward of being taught to read. To this
		promotion there are two conditions annexed, which form a <i xml:lang="la">sine qua
		non</i> of admission. The first is, that the scriptures without note
		or comment, should be read daily, the master selecting, according
		to my instruction, such parts as are best adapted to the age and
		capacity of his pupils; the second, that each child should bring
		a penny per week, to create a fund for winter clothing, books, or
		whatever occasion may require. In this way I endeavour to prevent
		the abuse of letters, by preparing the soil for their introduction.
		Respect for learning is increased, when it costs something to
		obtain it; and I find a test of sincerity is established to a
		certain degree by this small pecuniary condition, as people never
		pay for what they do not really desire to possess. Though the money
		thus collected returns whence it came, it goes back in another
		form. Like the dew, it rises in imperceptible vapour, and falls in
		palpable, and refreshing
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
								 showers. It requires a slight degree of
		self-denial, <em>even</em> to allot a penny per week in this manner; and
		there is a feeling of independence connected with every benefit
		which exercises individual frugality in its acquisition, while
		gratitude is still kept alive towards the fostering hands which
		deal out the fund so husbanded for general good. Then again, by not
		offering gratuitous teaching, I prevent many from coming, who would
		not turn their learning to good account, while I may always provide
		for an exception to my rule in supplying a worthy object who is too
		poor to <em>qualify</em>, with means of contributing the appointed mite."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Then, sir, I conclude that you think education may be spread too
		widely."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Certainly; in <em>this</em> country we cannot interfere with the
		religion of the <em>Mass</em>. If I could plant a Bible in every cottage,
		I would teach all men, women, and children to read it; but the
		accomplishment of reading considered, without reference to
		religious instruction, is about as necessary and suitable to a poor
		labouring man, as a gold snuff box would be; and it is to
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
																  me quite
		astonishing, that so many sober minds should give into the opposite
		absurdity which prevails at present, with a <em>rage</em> equal to that in
		the medical world for white mustard seed. We never think of silk
		gowns or fine cloth for the poor; we do not dream of serving up
		venison and turtle for them at a charity dinner; and, when sick, we
		do not order them the South of France, or prescribe hock, ice, and
		all the expensive delicacies become necessary to the luxury of our
		opulent higher classes. All things should <em>be in keeping</em>. A man
		who works for a shilling a day, eats his potatoes, and lies down
		to be refreshed by sleep for the morrow's labour, has no need of
		literature. It will neither make him happier nor better, unless you
		could secure the <em>use</em> of his acquirement in increased knowledge of
		the word of God. Our Irish Priests will not permit this. I do not
		mean to be hard upon them; they are a needy class, usually taken
		from the lowest conditions of life, and depending for subsistence
		on the measure of their influence with the people. To keep the
		minds of their flocks in absolute subjugation to
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
														 their authority,
		is essential to their very existence; and they are fearfully aware,
		that free access to the Bible would quickly destroy their power, by
		undermining its foundation."
	</p>

	<p>
		"At least," said I, "though the men cannot leave their spades, why
		not teach the women? <em>They</em> could instruct the children, and the
		next generation would reap the profit."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Pooh, my dear Arthur, you are a young theorist, and float with
		the fashionable tide. Whatever be the situation of one sex must
		be shared by the other. A pair of diamond earrings would be about
		as appropriate an appendage to the head of poor Susan, whom you
		visited this morning, as the History of England, or a Treatise
		on Political Economy would be in her hands. The thing is not
		wanted&mdash;it is out of place. The sordid cares of life leave little
		time for bodily rest or mental repose; and unless, as I said
		before, you can be sure of planting the one thing needful, every
		moment which could be stolen from household toil, and devoted to
		books, would be employed on the trash which is placed through the
		licentious <em>liberality</em> of the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
											press, within the grasp of all
		who desire to quaff at the feculent stream. Music is a pleasing
		resource, drawing is another, but you do not conceive these to be
		requisite for the well-being of our cottagers. How are reading,
		writing, arithmetic, and geometry, more allied to the happiness
		of an agricultural labourer than the former? Remember <em>always</em>
		that my argument only applies when the Bible is excluded or
		made subservient to the base purposes of secular advancement by
		hypocrites, who employ it as a stepping-stone to the favour of
		their superiors. Physicians do not read law, lawyers do not read
		physic, nor either of them military tactics&mdash;and why? Because they
		do not want a species of knowledge out of their department. The
		same rule may be generally applied. A poor cottager has nothing
		to do with letters, unless he be made better and happier by
		acquaintance with them; and should his attention be directed to the
		tirades of Messrs. Shiel and O'Connell, to the demoralizing details
		of practical vice with which our newspapers unfortunately abound;
		to the ethics of Mr. Cobbett or the religion of Mr.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
															Carlile,
		instead of to the Sacred Volume, I think that you must agree with
		me in doubting the growth of virtue and contentment as the result
		of such studies."
	</p>

	<p>
		I felt shaken, I must own, but replied, "The tide of public opinion
		is so forcible, that we are often drawn along with it before we
		are aware how far it will lead us. I confess that I have joined
		a hue and cry in favour of universal education, without thinking
		much about the matter. Experience, undoubtedly, must confirm or
		contradict the utility of its unlimited extension, and I shall be
		happy to hear your farther sentiments upon the subject, if you are
		not tired of my questions."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Indeed, my dear Howard, you shall ever find me ready and willing
		to discuss this and every other topic upon which I am capable of
		offering an opinion; but we must not pass the day of your first
		visit to Lisfarne, <em>at school</em>. We must have a little recreation
		this morning, or I should despair of your coming again to see old
		C[oe]lebs in his cell. I want to take you a walk along the sea
		shore, and, as the day is fine,

										I am going, with your permission,
		to send one of my young <em>footpads</em> over to Glenalta, to say that
		you will dine here; and should Oliphant arrive, as I think he
		probably will by this evening's coach, you will not regret being
		absent at the meeting, as you are a stranger to the good man."
	</p>

	<p>
		The name of Oliphant caused a sudden revulsion, and produced a
		complete <i xml:lang="fr">bouleversement</i> in all my pleasurable sensations. A
		stripling mountaineer was despatched, who flew like an arrow
		across the fields with Mr. Otway's message, and behold us arm in
		arm skirting the wood, and, ere long, approaching a bold headland
		which stood beautifully out into the bay. As we jogged on together,
		I felt growing more and more at ease with mine host, and at last
		ventured to give a vent to my <em>Oliphantphobia</em>, by saying, "How
		I dread this tiresome piece of parchment divinity that we are
		expecting! Adieu now to the cheerfulness of Glenalta. This old
		bookworm is, I suppose, my aunt's domestic sense-carrier, and will
		disapprove of every thing but black letter lore in the mornings,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
		and snuffling canticles for our evening diversion."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I think," said Phil. "that having found yourself deceived in so
		many preconceptions respecting Glenalta, you ought not to condemn
		poor Domine without benefit of clergy. Suspend your judgment. If
		you do not like him, you will differ widely from your family, but
		let him have fair play; I will not bespeak your favour, nor stand
		sponsor to your taste."
	</p>

	<p>
		We walked on, stopped now and then to look at the views, and, at
		length turning into a zig-zag path, arrived by a short circuit at
		a little spot of exquisite beauty. It was an arch-way rather than
		cavern in the rock, extending inwards no farther than to form a
		bower of stone, if you will admit such a description. Lined with
		ivy, which actually grows like a tissue fitted to the irregular
		surface, and almost buried in arbutus, it seemed as if the very
		Genius of Contemplation had selected this natural alcove for her
		favourite haunt. I stood wonder-struck by the scene, innumerable
		sea-birds wheeling round us, and uttering their plaintive wailings
		to the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
			   wind. Rocks, ocean, solitude wherever the eye could reach,
		while the sun-beams dancing on the calm surface of the "green one,"
		seemed to say, "you shall not indulge melancholy here."
	</p>

	<p>
		Mr. Otway appeared much pleased with my silent rapture, and, after
		a little pause, took me to a seat covered with the same luxuriant
		drapery which hung upon the rocky walls, and which, without any
		apparent assistance from art, formed a bench entirely round the
		cave.
	</p>

	<p>
		When we were seated, Mr. Otway, with a sigh which seemed to break
		from his heart, told me that this rude temple, hewn by nature from
		the wild mass of stone under the shelter of which we were now
		conversing, was sacred to my uncle.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Here have I sat for hours with Henry Douglas, the friend, the
		companion of my youth; and listened with unwearied delight to
		the flow of mind which poured its exhaustless treasure from his
		lips; sometimes expanding its stream to the amplitude of ocean,
		then narrowing its pellucid waves within confines of unrivalled
		fertility; and again, (if you will allow me to pursue the image,)
		still farther contracting its limits to dissport
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
														 occasionally amid
		the enchantments of rock and bower, scattering its spray in bright
		fantastic sparkles all around. You are to consider an introduction
		to this hallowed spot, which I have consecrated to his memory, as
		a distinguishing mark of the regard with which I wish to treat his
		nephew, and an earnest of that friendship, which if you desire to
		cultivate, I shall be happy to bestow on one so nearly allied to
		the man who, of all others, I most loved upon earth." There was a
		solemn tenderness in his manner which thrilled me; and I thanked
		him heartily, expressing as well as I could, how gratefully I felt
		inclined to profit by his kindness, adding, "I do not believe that
		I ever saw my uncle Henry: if I did, it must have been in early
		childhood, for I have no remembrance of him, but have often heard
		of him as a person rarely gifted."&mdash;"Yes,&mdash;had you ever seen him,
		he could never have been forgotten! there was an illumination in
		his very countenance which irresistibly seized upon the attention.
		The play of intelligence upon his features was like the summer
		lightning, 'as bright and harmless too;'
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
												 and, in him were combined
		'the wisdom of the serpent, with the innocence of the dove.' My
		dear departed Douglas possessed the most brilliant talents. Imagine
		these rising majestically from a solid plinth of boldest structure
		in religion and morals, while Fancy in her most tasteful mood
		had wreathed the light acanthus round his brow, and you may form
		some idea of the man who, in our youthful days, was always called
		the 'Corinthian pillar' of that little band in whose society he
		passed his hours of recreation. He was at once the most profound
		reasoner, the acutest critic, the soundest arbiter, and the
		kindest friend. The peculiar sensitiveness of his character never
		impaired its strength; and a remarkable accuracy of observation
		with which heaven had endowed him, acting in concert with an
		uncompromising integrity, imparted the influence of truth itself,
		to the decisions of his judgment. He saw whatever subject was
		presented to his understanding, in all its different bearings, with
		quickness bordering on intuition; and was enabled by the variety
		of his knowledge, to enter into the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
											minutest details, without
		diminishing the force of outline in any question that offered
		itself for discussion. As might be easily supposed, this assemblage
		of qualities, at once the most solid and attractive that I ever
		knew, was little comprehended by the generality of mankind. That
		noble independence which disdains the tricking arts of popularity,
		and <em>dares</em> to walk alone, was miscalled pride. The elegant
		retirement of a mind replete with resources, and too refined to
		consider as society what was not congenial companionship, was,
		with equal departure from just discrimination, styled misanthropy,
		while sensibility, which with magic touch can raise aërial hosts
		of imagery; and straying over the sacred expanse of time gone by,
		and yet to come, sighs to the memory of the past, or o'er the
		uncertainty of the future: this was <em>selfishness</em>, according to
		vulgar interpretation. But vice and folly are compelled to pay the
		reluctant homage of an involuntary respect at the shrine of virtue,
		and collective excellence is always sure to receive its tribute,
		however incapable the mass of mankind may prove to appreciate the
		individual
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
				   beauties of a character which they do not understand.
		<em>Such</em> tribute was paid in large proportion to my friend; and while
		kindred merit sought his acquaintance with enthusiasm, the <i>little
		world</i> were forced to gaze at him with reverence, and look up with
		veneration. He is gone! and I never visit this spot, associated
		peculiarly with his image, unaccompanied by the recollection of
		that epitaph at the Leasowes, the only beautiful testimony of
		surviving affection which I remember to have seen, and which seems
		as if written for Douglas, and for him alone.

	</div>

	<p>
		Mr. Otway paused, and I felt deeply affected by the impressive
		manner in which these eloquent lines were repeated. After a short
		silence, I told him how greatly I felt indebted for the animated
		sketch which he had just given me of a relation whom I had never
		till then heard so particularly described. "At Glenalta," said I,
		"there is no allusion ever made
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
										to my uncle, and I think, that I
		have already discovered, even at this distance of time from his
		death, that even the name of Henry cannot be pronounced without
		causing an inward convulsion of feeling in my aunt. At first I
		thought it impossible, but on reading a paragraph to her in the
		newspaper yesterday, I perceived a recurrence of such an expression
		in her countenance, as determined me to avoid producing it again,
		at least by a repetition of the same sound which gave rise to her
		present agitation."
	</p>

	<p>
		"This, my young friend," answered the admirable Otway, "is true
		to nature. In those horrible and overwhelming moments of recent
		disseverment, when the grave has just closed upon all that lived
		in our fondest affections,&mdash;when the affrighted spirit glances
		round upon the desert wilderness, and the tremendous solitude
		is only interrupted by images of despair,&mdash;then, <em>names</em> arrest
		not the attention. The throbbing heart is wrapped in present
		anguish, and the dull ear is dead to sounds; even the shade of the
		beloved might float upon the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
									 mourner's vision, and not surprise;
		but when the first agony of bereavement has settled into the
		waking consciousness of our loss, when the astonishment of death
		has subsided, when the phantoms of an amazed and distempered
		imagination no longer haunt the brain and people our dreams, then
		it is that the lonely heart sits in silent abandonment, and even
		'the willow that waves in the wind,' terrifies like a ghost of
		other times; associations rise, names startle, and in proportion
		as distance from the event diminishes the natural <em>right</em> to
		sympathy which great misfortunes claim in the first moments of
		their visitation, the delicate mind shrinks within itself fearful
		of repulse, and would hide its feelings even from the eye of day,
		lest it might seem to solicit a participation in those thoughts,
		which are too sacred to be shared. Caroline Douglas is not to be
		judged of by common-place criteria. When she and the partner of
		her affections took up their abode at Glenalta, they presented a
		picture of human felicity of which while 'memory holds her seat,'
		I shall never lose the most lively impression. Young, and united
		by the most
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
					perfect attachment, grounded upon an intimate and
		mutual acquaintance with disposition, character, sentiments, and
		opinions, the highest eulogium which it was possible to pass on
		either, might be comprised in one short sentence; they were formed
		for each other. Never did I behold two people knit together in
		bonds of love so tender, and friendship so rational. Every thought
		appeared to be held in common; and when they were conversing, it
		seemed as if the lips of one only gave utterance to that which in
		the same instant had started into life within the breast of the
		other. So perfect was the harmony of their souls, that every idea
		which arose in either mind, was caught by the other at a glance,
		improved and beautified ere it was reflected back again. In short,
		it was impossible that any one whose lot was not already cast,
		should enjoy the privilege of their intimacy, without becoming
		enamoured of a state capable of producing such celestial happiness
		as they were permitted to taste; while in proportion as the mind
		was disposed to offer a tribute of <em>abstract</em> homage at the altar
		of hymen, the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
					  dread of risking individual experiment would
		as naturally arise, lest mistaking an exception for the rule,
		disappointment should ensue as the fruit of imitation. But there
		are very few who marry upon the principles which governed their
		union; and to expect similar results from discordant motives, is to
		look for grapes on thorns, and figs on thistles. My friends were
		mutually attracted by esteem, as well as affection. They did not
		join their destinies upon the ground of external vanity, or the
		sordid views of worldly aggrandisement. Their's was not a marriage
		of two estates; they knew what to desire: they were aware of what
		they wanted, and were contented with what they possessed. How often
		have I heard them talk of riches and poverty, in this place where
		you and I are now sitting! how often heard them agree that a larger
		share of fortune's favour might render them less dependent perhaps,
		upon each other for happiness, and consequently, diminish the sum
		of it; thus would they render privation a subject for gratitude,
		through the love that they bore to each other."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
		"What a picture of earthly bliss," said I, "have you drawn, and
		what a separation was that of two beings so united!"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Aye, it was indeed a picture worth going any distance to gaze
		upon! It was a lesson never to be forgotten. Minds like those
		which I have been attempting to describe, possess the art of
		harmonizing every thing with which they come in contact in unison
		with themselves. True refinement inheres <em>within</em>, and no more
		derives its character from outward trappings, than heaven's gift
		of symmetry owes its fair proportions to the fringes with which
		fashion encumbers its beauty. In a cottage where luxury never
		visited, inborn elegance fixed her abode. A favorite author of
		mine says, that if death were considered stripped of the dreadful
		paraphernalia which generally attends its mournful presence, half
		its horrors would be annihilated. Of poverty, we may say the same.
		Vulgar people bring the machinery of life in all its ugliness
		and indelicacy before you. It is not whether your tables are of
		mahogany or deal; your dishes of china or delft which distinguishes
		<em>refinement</em>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
						  from its opposite. It is the soul that presides at
		the banquet. All this was so instinctively understood, by these
		pattern specimens of human nature, that dignity and ease, polish
		and simplicity, were the never-failing companions of their humble
		home. It is a theme which makes me forgetful of time. We will now
		bend our steps towards Lisfarne."
	</p>

	<p>
		As we rose, he continued:&mdash;
	</p>

	<p>
		"Over the misery which succeeded, I must, like Timanthes of
		old, draw a veil, for it was too painful to contemplate, even
		in painting. Douglas was snatched in the prime of life from the
		beloved of his bosom, from whom to part was the only anguish
		which religion had not yet taught him to endure with heavenly
		resignation. Even this bitter draught he learned at length to drink
		with Christian fortitude. No language could describe the scene of
		sorrow that I witnessed afterwards; but years have rolled away;
		the dear survivor lives to be a blessing still; and while with
		cheerfulness she can now mingle in the innocent gaieties of her
		children, her heart
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
		 is set on heaven where she hopes for re-union
		with the only loved of earth."
	</p>

	<p>
		Here ended a recital which I felt deeply interesting, partly
		perhaps because the actors in this sad tale were my nearest
		relations, and partly too on account of the noble characters which
		it pourtrayed. Falkland, I am growing serious in this place, and
		shall lose my spirits if I stay much longer here.
	</p>

	<p>
		As we turned from the <em>sacred</em> promontory, Mr. Otway playfully
		shook my elbow, and, by a sudden change in the modulation of his
		voice, made me feel that we were not to dwell any longer on the
		topic which had occupied the preceeding hour. At his request I gave
		him a history of my <em>life and adventures</em>. We talked of you, and
		I so completely <em>fired</em> him by my subject, that he has taken your
		address, and means immediately to write to young Stanhope who, with
		his tutor, (a nephew, by the bye of Oliphant's) is to be at Pisa
		about the time of your arrival there, to make your acquaintance
		with all suitable activity. Mr. Otway gives a good character of his
		ward, so that probably you may find him worth knowing;
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
															   but if not
		for his own sake, you will I am assured <em>fly to the meeting</em> for
		the sake of your romance; and consider the youth as a link in that
		mysterious <em>concatenation</em>, by which your fate <em>or</em> your fancy is
		bound to Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		Before we re-entered the house, Mr. Otway desired me to follow him
		down a winding-path, at the end of which I found myself within a
		nice little enclosure, sheltered by a hawthorn hedge which was
		bursting into a sheet of fragrant blossoms. "This is my botanic
		garden," said my companion, "and I must not forget to send Fanny
		some plants which I promised her. Here, Howard, help me to take
		these to the gardener, and he shall send them over to my little
		pupil."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I will take them myself in the evening," said I, "and shall have
		the benefit of appearing very learned, if you will tell me their
		names. Emily has extracted a promise from me in our walk from the
		mountain this morning, to put myself under her tuition while I
		remain in these flowery regions, so the sooner I begin my task the
		better."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
		"You are very right," replied 'mine host;' "knowledge is never a
		burthen; and when the news of London is once told, and the stimulus
		of novelty wears off, we shall then feel the full value of such
		pursuits as at once sustain social communion, exercise common
		curiosity, and employ the powers of the understanding."
	</p>

	<p>
		"You told me this morning, Mr. Otway, that you think the mania
		for education is outrunning its natural progress; and that it is
		the fashion at present to overleap the barrier of prudence in a
		premature and forced extension of learning. May I not urge your
		zeal in favour of female cultivation as somewhat inconsistent
		with this theory? Setting all jocularity aside, and banishing
		<em>nicknames</em>, as you call them, from our inquiry, will you tell me
		if utility be the measure by which you ascertain and determine
		the question of what possible use is education, beyond the polite
		limits of fashionable acquirement amongst the higher orders, and
		the necessary qualifications for a housewife in the lower classes?
		Can women keep schools for our youth? Can women occupy professors'
		chairs? Are women
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
						  called upon to write works of science? In short,
		do women ever <em>want</em> all this lore? and if not, might not their
		time be more valuably employed in cultivating the delightful arts
		of pleasing? I confess to you," added I, "that I have a little
		scheme of trying to save Fanny, who is as yet a child, and a very
		engaging one too, from going through the ordeal which her sisters
		have passed. They are sweet girls, and certainly have contributed
		to soften my prejudices exceedingly against learned ladies. Still,
		however, it is a pity not to spare Fanny the trouble as well as the
		hazard of becoming one. <em>You</em> are so looked up to at Glenalta, that
		if you are on the opposition benches I may despair of a majority,
		so pray answer me seriously."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I will, indeed," answered Phil, "though I cannot help laughing at
		your pity and intended kindness, for which, however the <em>motive</em>
		may secure your pardon, my little Fan would certainly not thank
		you as gratefully as you expect. To answer your question will in
		no wise perplex me. Utility is a test by which I am very well
		satisfied to abide; and, if we try the matter
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
													  at present in debate
		by that rule, I think I shall be able to convince you, that unless
		in <em>our</em> sex education is to lower its tone, or be neglected, there
		can be no doubt of the advantage which would be gained by the solid
		instruction of the female world. You grant that it is to women we
		ought to look for all that is most valuable in first impressions.
		Boys rarely quit their homes before ten years of age, and girls,
		not generally speaking, till they marry. It seems then to require
		no argument to prove, that upon a mother's being fond of her home,
		and satisfied with the pleasures of her domestic fire-side, must
		depend an <em>inclination</em> to give up society abroad for the good
		of her family; at least you will grant, without difficulty that,
		though a sense of duty may do much with the truly conscientious,
		the union of duty and inclination will work double tides&mdash;so far we
		must be agreed. Now the question which remains is, <em>how</em> the love
		of home may be produced, and here I should have no hesitation in
		saying, by a marriage, in which the greatest portion of sympathy
		can be found, and, consequently, the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
											 greatest number of common
		pursuits. The amusements of young men at the present day&mdash;I mean
		the majority are such as no female can join in&mdash;hunting, shooting,
		horse-racing, pugilism, rowing matches, are diversions exclusively
		appertaining to the mass of our male population of the gentry
		class. Now we will, if you please, suppose two families:&mdash;the first
		shall be composed of a Gentleman, who has been bred at one of the
		great schools without making a figure in scholarship of any kind,
		and who, having passed through the University in a manner equally
		undistinguished, and vapoured at balls, concerts, and parties, lost
		his money at play, and gone the rounds of fashionable dissipation,
		marries at length to repair his fortune and improve his interest;
		and a young Lady who plays on the harp and piano forte, draws a
		little, dances and dresses according to the last French receipt.
		This happy pair set up an establishment. If rich, they live in a
		whirl of company, sometimes at home, but more frequently abroad.
		When children come, they are committed to the care of servants and
		the nursery
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
					governess, till a time arrives for sending the boys to
		school, and exchanging the humble services of the infant teacher
		for the <i xml:lang="fr">Ma'amoiselle</i>, who, more like a dancing dog than a human
		being, takes charge of the girls, and becomes the guardian of
		their religion, morals, and manners! Perhaps you interrupt me, ere
		my conclusion be drawn, to observe that this representation only
		applies to what are called the higher circles. Very well&mdash;be it
		so; you shall have the advantage of a second statement upon <em>your</em>
		side before I contrast it with <em>my</em> view of the subject. Let us
		suppose a Gentleman of a thousand a year, or a Professional man,
		the former may, or may not, have profited more by his school and
		collegiate course than the man of fashion. The latter is obliged
		to plod his weary way through law or physic for his daily bread.
		These Gentlemen marry, and, according to the present modes of
		female education, are not likely to be much happier than our former
		Benedick; for a young Lady, now-a-days, whose fortune is no more
		than a thousand pounds, learns exactly the same things which are
		taught
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
			   to the daughters of a Duke; and it depends upon original
		genius whether her accomplishments be more or less shining than
		those of her more splendid models. But music and drawing, however
		well performed, can enter but a little way into the happiness of a
		fire-side in the country, or that of a Barrister or Physician in
		town, when compared with the comforts which <em>might</em> result from a
		different order of things. Take a peep now into a <i xml:lang="fr">menage</i>, such as
		I wish were not too often to be found only in an air-built castle."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Imagine a well-educated man, who, not stopping at the animal
		qualifications of eating, drinking, boxing, and fox-hunting, has
		cultivated his mind, and acquired a taste for literature, will
		not such a man be likely to enjoy more happiness at home, if he
		has a companion capable of participating in his most rational
		gratifications? Will a sensible man admire an amiable woman
		less, because in addition to whatever personal qualities may
		have endeared her to his affections, she is possessed of solidly
		useful knowledge which she is capable of imparting
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
														   to her
		offspring? Surely not; to maintain the contrary, would be to pass
		the severest censure on our sex. A woman is neither less pretty,
		less elegant, less kind, nor less accomplished of <em>necessity</em>,
		because she has read and loves reading; and, considering her <em>own</em>
		happiness, can there be any question respecting the advantage of
		books as a source of amusement as well as usefulness, above all
		the lighter acquirements above enumerated? The former pass away
		with the careless gaiety of youth. The rising generation steps
		close upon the heels of that which has immediately preceded it;
		and as novelty is the very essence of fashion, the singing which
		has been heard, and the dancing which has been seen for a few
		successive winters cease to charm, and newer attractions occupy
		the stage. How much would the respect of children towards their
		mothers be increased, were women, generally speaking, capable of
		taking part in the instruction of a family, attending to their
		interests, exercising a sound judgment on their progress, and
		accompanying their pursuits! Reflect upon the numbers who are left
		widows to guide
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
						sons, as well as daughters, through the thorny
		paths of life? Is it of no importance that a woman, whom it has
		pleased God to make the solitary guardian of a youthful progeny,
		should place her affections on higher objects than dress, cards,
		theatres? Is it of no use that she should be able to direct the
		eternal interests of her children, and watch, as a careful nurse,
		over their temporal welfare? And will she be less the object of
		veneration and love, because every hour of the day presents some
		variety of cheerful companionship, where utility and pleasure go
		hand in hand, and knowledge is delightful, because associated with
		maternal tenderness? Believe not such untruths, my dear Howard, and
		if you ever marry, beware of those idle butterflies who, having
		skimmed through a summer's day, flutter their fading wings and are
		forgotten. Such women are, indeed, but children of a larger growth,
		and totally unfit for the responsibility which devolves upon them.
		But do not suppose that by a sweeping clause, as false as it would
		be uncharitable, I mean to include the <em>entire</em> world of fashion
		in the denunciation
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
							which I have pronounced against modern modes
		and manners. There are some beautiful exceptions, which not only
		have escaped contagion, but which illustrate my position by being
		themselves amongst its brightest examples. It is the <em>general</em>
		evil of which I complain, and unless women will stand their <em>own</em>
		friends, and resist the tyranny of opinion which, if it proceed
		much farther in its present course, bids fair to deprive them of
		those faculties which Heaven has bountifully bestowed, they may
		rest assured that their power will daily decline; both sexes will
		degenerate, and the rude supremacy of physical strength will be at
		last resorted to, to complete female subjugation, and bring the
		civilized world again to a state of barbarism from which it will
		slowly emerge."
	</p>

	<p>
		Just as I was going to reply, a servant announced Mr. Bentley.
		A young man entered the room, and we were ere long summoned to
		dinner. Nothing could be more agreeable than the trio. You see that
		I include myself in the compliment to our good humour, ease, and
		festivity. Phil. is an extraordinary man, and I am
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
															much <em>taken</em>
		with him. He is a perfect Encyclopedia, as little Fanny called him,
		and literally seems to know every thing; but so absolutely is he
		divested of the pomps and ceremony of literature, that it is only
		by the fulness of your own mind, and the number of new ideas that
		you find in your brain, that you discover the superiority of him
		from whom you have derived such accession to your thoughts. We ate,
		drank, and were merry.
	</p>

	<p>
		Bentley is a very sensible young man, and a near neigbour of Mr.
		Otway's.
	</p>

	<p>
		I suppose that I must tell you what we talked of. Well, I am
		patiently going through my task of <em>minute</em> narrative in the
		beginning; but by the time that you are acquainted with the
		characters around me, through these my <em>masterly</em> sketches you
		must prepare to take your leave of such reports. I shall write
		regularly, and mention whatever incidents may occur; but to hold
		on in this method, of repeating every word that is uttered, would
		be more than flesh and blood are equal to. Besides, should money
		fall short, you may take advantage of me, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
													  make a book out of
		these my voluminous materials. Thus forestalling, for all you can
		possibly tell, my intentions of giving so many sapient observations
		as I have committed to paper, one day myself to the world.
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, but you want to know who Bentley is, and what we talked
		about. As to who a young man, living in the county of Kerry in
		Ireland, may be, I am not quite ready to answer though <i xml:lang="fr">faute
		d'autres sujets</i>, I shall inquire more concerning him; perhaps
		somewhat more determined in my design so to do, from having
		remarked a scarlet blush pass over his cheek at dinner when
		Charlotte's name was mentioned.
	</p>

	<p>
		In these back settlements there is nothing to do, but exercise the
		skill of a calm observer; and I expect to be quite <i xml:lang="fr">au fait</i> as a
		critic in every thing appertaining to countenance, by the time that
		I return to the world. As to conversation we had a great deal of
		one sort or other. Some politics, some anecdote, some I know not
		what, pleasant enough, but nothing striking. I remember only two
		remarks that I shall take the trouble of exporting to Pisa.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
																	We
		were speaking of Scott's Novels (for I take the liberty of calling
		them his, notwithstanding all the denials which are cited to prove
		the contrary<a name="FNanchor_A_2" id="FNanchor_A_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>) and I instanced these and some other works of
		fiction which are justly celebrated, and of recent publication, to
		support my opinion, that the present genius of literature stands
		upon a lofty pedestal in comparison with former times, adding
		"what can be a stronger argument in favour of modern wisdom than
		that <em>such</em> books are the recreation of our contemporaries?" A
		stranger just set down in England might naturally say, if this be
		<em>amusement</em>, what are the <em>serious</em> studies in this country? And
		if, as some writer has said, "tell me your diversions, and I'll
		tell you what you are," carry any weight, we may fairly claim to
		high pre-eminence."
	</p>

	<p>
		"And deserve it too," answered Phil., "if we do not push the
		argument too far. The present day furnishes us some admirable
		samples in the department of fiction; but I question much if you
		will not find, that novels, with a
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
										   large portion of existing men,
		and women, make the <em>business</em>, as well as the relaxation of their
		reading hours. The novels of our time are like letters of marque.
		They are <i xml:lang="fr">armés en flute</i> for war or merchandize, <em>alias</em> for
		instruction or entertainment; and if people will not read any thing
		more serious we must be happy that there <em>is</em> a method of riveting
		attention by cloathing good sense in the light drapery of fiction.
		Thousands are led on to better things than they are promised by
		a pleasant tale; and I rejoice to perceive a growing sense of
		accountableness in the writers who supply the present rage for
		new publications. I see a consciousness arising amongst novelists
		and the editors of reviews and magazines that the morbid diseases
		induced by <em>mental</em> opium eating (if you will allow me the image)
		threaten paralysis and, would inevitably lead to dissolution of all
		intellectual energy, if not arrested in their progress. Several
		are usefully employed in applying alterations, and endeavouring to
		bring about a more healthful action of the rational powers. Let
		us earnestly desire a blessing on every effort
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
													   of this nature,
		and give our best individual support even to story, when, like
		the useful wedge, it is successful in sliding in, what would not
		find its way into the hands of half mankind unaided by such an
		instrument." The remark struck me as valid, and I had the grace to
		say so. Led on from one topic to another, in which this excellent
		man discovered so much knowledge of life as perfectly to amaze me,
		I turned to young Bentley, and said, "I have often heard people
		obtain credit for extraordinary acquaintance with the world, and
		wherever this has been the case, such skill has been attributed to
		travelling, and a widely spreading communion with various classes
		of men; but it sometimes strikes me as matter of surprise to find
		the acutest sense of all that is doing on the great theatre, in
		a retired corner of the earth, apparently shut out from all the
		bustle, vice, and folly, that pervade the world."
	</p>

	<p>
		Bentley replied, "I know not to whom you may apply for information
		on <em>this</em> head, more appropriately than to my good friend of
		Lisfarne, who contrives to know mankind so well
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
														without going
		amongst them. Let us ask him how he manages to find them out?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Were it really the case," answered Phil. "that I am better
		informed than my neighbours in the science which you ascribe to me;
		a point which I utterly dissent from, I should be apt perhaps to
		take credit for my skill as resulting from the very reason that,
		according to your view, might excuse its deficiency, namely, to
		those retired habits which lead me to study a few, rather than
		glance my eye over a multitude. It is with men as with books. You
		may skim over too great a number to read any with profit. With some
		few exceptions, the characters of which mankind is made up, are
		easily classified; and if you master a score of distinct specimens
		from each tribe with care and accuracy, you will find the sum of
		your knowledge considerably to exceed that which has been gleaned
		from a larger surface, where less attention has been brought to
		the task of investigation. A certain impatience of decision leads
		people frequently to pronounce upon as anomalies,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
														  what a severer
		scrutiny would prove to be well understood, and belonging to
		accredited divisions of human character."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I seldom meet with a <em>real</em> non-descript, though appearances may
		puzzle me for a time, and though I have not been in a crowd for
		many years, I meet in succession with individuals of all sorts, and
		perhaps am enabled to form a more discriminating judgment of each
		single figure as it passes before me than I could do were my mind
		distracted by many objects together. The whole being made up of
		parts, one may give a shrewd guess at the collective effect from
		acquaintance with the separate atoms."
	</p>

	<p>
		"From what you say," said I, "a man ought to live <em>out</em> of the
		world, to judge rightly of those men who compose it."&mdash;"No, my
		young friend, not quite so <em>terse</em>. There is no more <em>necessary</em>
		connection between knowledge of the world and retirement, than
		between naval tactics and an old gentleman sitting by his fireside
		in Hampshire; yet it so happened, that the present system of
		breaking the line, which was of such astonishing importance to
		us in the last war, was
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
								the invention of a man unconnected with
		naval affairs, and who, marshalling a parcel of cherry-stones
		after dinner upon his table, proved to a practical understanding
		how the object could be achieved, and what a Clarke projected, was
		accomplished by a Rodney."
	</p>

	<p>
		"<em>In</em> the world or <em>out</em> of the world sagacity may find materials
		upon which to work, and it will depend on the acuteness of that
		sagacity to arrive at eminence in the knowledge of man.&mdash;Where this
		is furnished, I should believe retirement, I do not mean solitude,
		to be more favorable to sound discrimination than a busy scene,
		because more likely to secure against precipitancy of judgment.
		On the whole, we may see, and hear, a great deal too much with
		our <em>outward</em> senses. The principal defect of the present day is
		want of reflection. The provision, the apparatus for conveying
		instruction to the mind is superb, but exactly in proportion to
		these "tricking facilities" is the deficiency of original thinking.
		When books were few, and purchased with difficulty, they were
		intensely studied. The mind was forced to be in some
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
															 sort its
		own library. The treasures of learning were committed to memory,
		and the intellect traded upon its internal resources; the capital
		was frequently turned, and mental riches crowned exertion; but
		the multiplication of <em>means</em> often retards the <em>end</em>, and the
		understanding is encumbered with help."
	</p>

	<p>
		"But pray, sir, if we gain more in expansion than we lose in depth,
		is not the balance on our side? Now that the press is teeming
		with instruction brought down to the level of <em>all</em> capacities,
		are we not advancing by rapid strides to a full developement of
		the reasoning faculty, and approaching that happy termination of
		ignorance so devoutly to be wished for?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"I do not agree with you, Howard. If you desire my opinion, it must
		be given in the negative. I am an old-fashioned fellow, and many of
		my notions are desperately heretical in these days of display. I
		cannot help prefering substance to shadows, and depth to surface.
		I love real improvements, not mere changes. In some instances
		we <em>are</em> improving. The exact sciences are making progress, and
		so are those arts which
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
								depend upon the application of their
		principles. Chemistry, mechanics, &amp;c. advance, and there is a
		disposition to reward the talent that is exhibited in forwarding
		them to perfection; but I maintain that the system of school and
		collegiate education for our youth requires reform. The best part
		of life, as regards some of our mental powers, is frittered away
		in learning badly two dead languages, to the neglect of better
		things at school; and at the Universities much might be done to
		effect a better order of things than prevails in any of them. Then,
		with respect to the prevailing taste in literature, it is too
		much devoted to <em>stimulus</em>. We have too many new books, and too
		many young authors. Some expatiating in the labyrinths of moral
		paradox&mdash;others in the wild regions of uncontrolled imagination;
		and so on. Whatever is <em>new</em>, is devoured with avidity, and so
		great is the quantity, so pulp-like the quality, of this literary
		pabulum, that the digestive organs are destroyed, and the mind is
		seldom exercised for itself."
	</p>

	<p>
		As Phil. finished the last sentence, his old servant opened the
		door, and in ran Frederick,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
									followed by the redoubtable Domine. A
		general commotion ensued. Much shaking of hands, inquiries after
		health, friends, and all the etceteras which are hurried over in
		the first ten minutes after meeting succeeded, I was presented;
		and while Mr. Otway was engaged with Oliphant, and Fred. was
		interchanging civilities with Mr. Bentley, I sat examining the
		object of my fearful anticipations. Imprimis, he has no wig, but
		a fine expansive front with a clean bald pate. His hair "a sable
		silvered," scantily <em>set</em>, but curling naturally in a <em>fringe</em>
		round the back of his head, and a countenance full of benevolence,
		and sparkling with affection.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yes, it is a true bill. Here are more fruits of Prophecy and
		Prejudice, quoth you!&mdash;I will give up <em>anticipating</em>.&mdash;It will save
		me a great deal of plague in future, not to think of people till
		they cross my path, and are actually before my eyes.
	</p>

	<p>
		Before we set out on the return to Glenalta, I was as easy as
		an old shoe with Oliphant; but all his quaint practice and
		methodistical habits are hanging over <i xml:lang="la">in terrorem</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
		On the following day, which was Saturday, we met as usual at
		breakfast, and immediately afterwards, I was called by the girls
		and Frederick to come and see the treasures of which their tutor
		had been the escort. On entering the Library, I saw a valuable
		addition to the book-shelves; Clarke's Bible, handsomely, but
		unshewily bound, for my aunt; the Flora and Pomona Londinensis for
		Emily; a capital Biographical Dictionary for Charlotte; a fine
		Herodotus for Fred; and Withering's Botany for Fan. Besides these
		were writing-desks, drawing-books, pencils, port-folios, and a
		parcel containing the Pirates, Kenilworth, Quentin Durward, and the
		Inheritance, as food for the "Evening hour." In short, Domine must
		have been literally built up in the <em>stack</em> which brought him, as
		tightly as poor Rose de Beverley in the dungeon wall; and to have
		seen the good man <i xml:lang="fr">deterré</i> from such a mass of matter must have
		been diverting enough.
	</p>

	<p>
		These various objects of acquisition were all gifts of Mr. Otway,
		who had made his own remarks upon the wants and wishes of his
		neighbours,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
					and written to Oliphant accordingly, to come laden
		with whatever he thought most likely to gratify the family group.
		It is impossible to form an idea of the advantages in <em>one</em> respect
		which people living in these outposts of mankind possess over the
		civilized world. If my mother and sisters require a packet of
		books, or any thing else, from town, Gibson is ordered to write,
		the things come per next mail. Turner, my mother's maid, opens
		the store, and the contents are spread upon tables, where perhaps
		they lie for days before they are observed, and when looked at,
		are either to be returned, or if retained, it is ten to one if
		they produce the slightest degree of animation. Here the minds
		of the little party are so alive and fresh, that one catches the
		contagion; and I found myself bustling through wrapping papers and
		twine with an eagerness which I certainly never experienced upon
		the arrival of a similar importation at Selby.
	</p>

	<p>
		"We have been so long <em>wishing</em> for these," said Emily, "that they
		are quite a mine of happiness."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
		"Yes," answered Charlotte, "and how magical are our dear Phil.'s
		guesses, for he always discovers what one <em>wants</em> most." "And I,"
		added Fanny, "am just expiring to be off to Lisfarne, with a budget
		of thanks to our necromancer."
	</p>

	<p>
		We all dispersed after this library scene; the young people to shew
		Mr. Oliphant puppies, kittens, young pheasants, and sundry other
		live stock, which had either grown or been acquired during his
		absence, and I, after promising to walk with my aunt in an hour
		or two, filed off to my room to fold up this enormous volume. On
		looking over my journal before doing so, I perceived an omission:
		you desired me to tell you more of the <em>tastes</em> of my fair friends
		in dress, furniture, <i xml:lang="fr">etcetera</i>, I thought that I had given you a
		<i xml:lang="fr">coup d'oeil</i> which might have sufficed; but if you must have
		more, learn now, and for ever after hold your peace, that you may
		walk from top to bottom of this house without hitching your skirts
		in any of the fopperies of a modern <i xml:lang="fr">boudoir</i>. There is no danger
		of being entangled amongst a nest of spider-tables
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
														   covered with
		china, or of overturning a chiffoniere burthened with flower-pots.
		There are no scraps of japan, nor <em>odds</em> and <em>ends</em> of any sort to
		molest a visitor, and interrupt conversation. Glenalta is furnished
		with simplicity and convenience: the general <em>character</em>, is that
		of chaste uniformity, without any thing of the <em>drab</em> of quakerism.
		A few good pictures ornament the walls both of drawing-room and
		parlour. Some handsome busts in bronze give a finish to the
		bookcases of the library; and the hall, which is light and airy,
		has a very good appearance as you enter the house. The furniture is
		solid, and there is every real comfort of polished life to be found
		in its place without any exhibition of finery or <em>nick-knackery</em>,
		if I may coin a word for the occasion.&mdash;Altogether the best idea
		I can convey of my aunt's dwelling, is by telling you what it
		is <em>not</em>: it is <em>not</em> a <em>shew</em>-house&mdash;it is <em>not</em> a fashionable
		house, neither has it the cold, raw, uninhabited look of an English
		provincial residence; but it is strictly clean, bright, <em>easy</em>
		looking, and has an air of unpretending elegance.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
		Now, as to dress, hang me if I know the names of any manufacture;
		but I told you before, that the cousins have very pretty figures,
		beautiful hair, and are always perfectly <em>presentable</em>. They do
		not wear the gaudy colouring of the French school, nor are they
		squeezed as if in a vice, to look like wasps, without any visible
		connecting link to unite the upper and lower parts of the body.
		There is a natural grace and gentility in every movement; and the
		<em>effect</em> is pleasing to the eye from the <em>repose</em> which it meets
		with, equally remote from <em>excitement</em> on the one hand, and torpor
		on the other.
	</p>

	<p>
		What can I tell you more particular? And had I not better say Adieu
		at once, than add to this mighty mass of paper by further general
		description?

	</h3>


	<p class="salut">
		My dear Falkland,
	</p>

	<p>
		My last despatch, you will remember, was sealed just after it had
		been arranged that I should accompany my aunt in a walk. At the
		appointed hour I tapped at her door, to put her in mind of our
		assignation; and was not sorry to have a <i xml:lang="fr">tête à tête</i> in prospect,
		thinking that I might take advantage of this opportunity to edge
		in a little word of counsel, that might be of use, at <em>least</em> in
		Fanny's, though Emily and Charlotte might be beyond my reach in
		effecting a change in <em>their</em> destiny.
	</p>

	<p>
		My sweet aunt (for she is really quite delightful) was speedily
		equipped, and we set out upon our rambles. As soon as we had
		cleared the house, and were not in danger of being overheard, I
		expressed my gratitude for her
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
										kindness in asking me to Glenalta;
		spoke of the pleasure which I already felt in its society, and my
		admiration, as well as surprise, at finding my cousins every thing
		that could be wished. My aunt smiled. "Then," said she, "you had
		heard, I suppose, but an unflattering account of us, and expected
		to see a very <i xml:lang="fr">outrè</i> sort of a family." "I expected," answered
		I, "to find, as I <em>have</em> found, very superior attainments; but
		you know, dearest lady, the prejudice which universally subsists
		against <em>Blue-Stockings</em>; and though you have succeeded so
		admirably in the result of your system, and may therefore triumph,
		as 'those who win may laugh,' yet you must allow the experiment
		to have been a bold one." "And why so, my dear Arthur? I should
		not have felt at all inclined to make bold experiments, and am not
		conscious how I have done so. You must explain yourself." "Well
		then, I will; and hope that I may venture to do so without running
		any risk of offending you." "Certainly, I cannot be offended,
		having requested you to tell me what you mean; and I, on my part,
		shall not only thank you for your
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
										  observations, but shall be
		ready, with the most perfect candour, to satisfy you as far as I
		can, respecting my conduct."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Dear aunt, then," said I, "the great object to which a girl's
		prospects should tend from infancy to maturity is marriage; and
		every prudent mother, I need not say to you, is perpetually intent
		upon this termination of all her cares and anxiety. To marry a
		daughter <em>well</em> is no easy matter now-a-days, and often requires a
		vast deal of address to bring about the event. Beauty, though very
		captivating, will not do without money, and young men have learned
		to be philosophers; they can see and admire, but, like the Baron
		of Moubray, they must know how 'to love and to ride away,' unless
		they would entail ruin on their posterity. Almost every man's
		circumstances are dipped more or less, either by his own folly or
		that of his predecessors; and most men look to a fortunate marriage
		some time or other in their lives, for the purpose of paying off
		charges on their property, and clearing a load of debt. Now, girls
		of large fortune, may certainly take some liberties;
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
															 for even
		were they old, ugly, or <em>Blue</em>, thousands <em>will</em> tell, and they
		may generally command a choice amongst the other sex; but young
		women, even of such personal attraction as my cousins ought 'to be
		with caution bold.' I do assure you, that were you at this moment
		suddenly removed to London, I would not, for any consideration
		that I can name, that Emily and Charlotte were discovered to know
		a syllable of Greek, Latin, botany, chemistry, or any of the arts
		and sciences: it is unheard of in town, except to be laughed at, or
		avoided; and as your girls have pretensions that might secure their
		being courted in the best society, it would mortify any one who
		loves them to witness a complete failure in their <em>debut</em>, through
		a want of that circumspection which mothers, <em>so</em> inferior to you,
		know how to exercise. Dear little Fan is young and volatile; there
		is more danger of her betraying herself than of her sisters' being
		giddy. Much might be done still with your elder girls, who are so
		reasonable and so docile, that they would probably take a hint
		immediately; but it is quite a <em>sin</em> not to snatch Fanny
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
																	  from
		perdition, by allowing what <em>azure</em> she has already contracted, to
		fade away as quickly as possible. Elegant and accomplished, pretty
		and pleasing, my cousins are formed for the world, and would shine
		in it: but Greek, Latin, chemistry, <i xml:lang="fr">etcetera</i>, are like forgery,
		never to be forgiven."
	</p>

	<p>
		Here I paused, and my aunt calmly replied, "I fear, my dear boy,
		that I shall make matters worse rather than better by my answer to
		your advice; but, notwithstanding, I must run the risk, and boldly
		hazard the loss of your esteem, by detailing some opinions of
		mine, which do not harmonize at all with your's. First, then, you
		will stare at me perhaps when I tell you, that I am very far from
		thinking marriage necessary to the happiness of my children, though
		should I live to see them find such partners as I think worthy of
		them, I should rejoice, inasmuch as, under <em>certain</em> circumstances,
		I look upon marriage as the happiest lot of life in this chequered
		scene; but, Arthur, rank and fortune are only <em>accidents</em>, and
		make no part of the <em>essence</em> in my creed of such requisites as
		constitute felicity in
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
							   domestic union. My dear girls will not be
		rich, but they will have enough to make them independent. If they
		marry, I think I may venture to say, that it will not be through
		worldly motives of aggrandizement; and should they remain single,
		they will, I trust in the Almighty, be both useful and contented."
	</p>

	<p>
		I certainly <em>did</em> stare. What! a mother, and disregard the
		establishment of daughters! My aunt continued: "According to your
		ideas, a woman is merely an appendage, and, I dare say, frequently
		considered a very troublesome one to her fortune, the acquisition
		of which seems to be, even under favourable circumstances of youth
		and beauty thrown into the scale, the <em>principal</em> object, and where
		these may be wanting, the <em>sole</em> incentive which leads a man of
		fashion to permit a young lady the honour of bearing his name.
		Now in a country where the blessing of freedom has never been
		known, where parents possess absolute power over their children,
		and masters over their slaves, I can perceive a reason for such
		an order of things; but I confess myself so ignorant
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
															 as not to
		comprehend why liberty and affluence <em>here</em> should be sacrificed
		without any valuable consideration. It would be better to subscribe
		a part of one's property to the necessities of a needy gentleman
		than be obliged to give up the whole, and tie oneself to him for
		ever. May I ask you how women are compensated in your scheme for
		the relinquishment of independence?" "Bless me, dear aunt, the
		question is so extraordinary, that really I feel at a loss to
		believe that you can ask it: <em>compensated</em>?&mdash;Why, by being married;
		by being promoted to a state in society of more consideration than
		they previously occupied; by being provided for, established, and,
		finally, as the acme of all female hope and ambition, taken out of
		the never-ending defile of recruits through which a man has to make
		his way at every ball, concert, or theatre in town."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Well," said Mrs. Douglas, "I am not a little amazed that these
		<em>recruits</em>, as you call them, should be ready to place themselves
		under the control of officers so little disposed to regard them
		with tenderness; but, as this is a serious
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
												   subject in which the
		happiness of mankind at large is concerned, we will treat it
		gravely. Providence has so ordered the affairs of earth, that
		marriage will always be a primary object of concern with <em>both</em>
		sexes; for remember, that the idea of <em>wife</em>, involves that of
		<em>husband</em>; and to supply each <em>aspirant</em> of either sex, you must
		find a disengaged individual of the other. Now if it appear that
		the mass of human beings are intended by their Creator for the
		state of matrimony, and that their own wishes generally coincide
		with the original purpose of creation, would it not seem a
		reasonable consequence that a condition which almost all men and
		women anticipate, should be rendered as desirable, as suitable, as
		happy, and as wise as a reflecting choice can make it?" "Surely,"
		said I, "and <em>there</em> lies the difference between an improvident
		silly mother, or one who is governed by a prudent knowledge of
		the world, and clear views of her childrens' advantage. Women
		are, you will confess, great fools when they allow their girls
		to flirt with younger sons who have nothing; military men, whose
		fortunes are on their
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
							  backs, and all the idle host who furnish
		a drawing-room and excel in a quadrille. Maternal solicitude
		ought unquestionably to be directed to a good settlement, liberal
		pin-money&mdash;if <em>possible</em> a distinguished connection; and in short,
		all the circumstances which constitute what every one admits to be
		a <em>good match</em>. How painful must it be to read a paragraph in the
		public papers announcing that on such a day Mr. Such-an-one, whom
		nobody knows, was married by some clergyman whose name was never
		heard of, in a parish church not to be found in any map, to Miss
		Douglas of Glenalta! If I am doomed to suffer such disgrace, I
		shall set out directly for Greece, or some other distant quarter to
		which my countrymen do not flock in the crowds that one is certain
		to meet in France and Italy, <em>there</em> to remain till the event is
		forgotten, and the unfortunate actors in it, are consigned to
		well-merited oblivion. Forgive me if I am warm; I do not mean to
		be disrespectful, but my energies rise in proportion to the hourly
		increase of love and admiration which I feel towards relations so
		near and so deserving."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
		"Arthur, I am not angry," rejoined my aunt, "but I must oppose,
		though I may fail to convince you; I can never desire to see my
		dear girls, who have been loved, valued, and considered as rational
		creatures in their own home, become a part of the <em>retinue</em> of a
		man of fashion; and therefore I neither intend to introduce them
		upon a theatre where success is failure according to my notion of
		things, nor attempt to infuse a new class of doctrines upon the
		nature of happiness into their guiltless hearts. Let us go on in
		our accustomed routine, and if there ever was a case to which we
		may apply the maxim 'If ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise,'
		you will admit its force upon that in question, for <em>so</em> happy are
		my dear children at Glenalta, that visionary dreams of joy seem
		not to pass beyond its well-known boundary. When the mind is full
		of resource, it is wonderfully independent, and suffers none of
		that <i xml:lang="fr">ennui</i> which is the disease of vacancy. From the birth of
		my children to the present time, they have never heard that there
		was an <em>effect</em> to be produced by any thing they learned except
		the natural consequences

								 that grow out of virtue and occupation.
		Marriage may, or may not, be their portion; should it be so, the
		characters of their husbands may probably differ, as their own do,
		from each other; and thus far I meet your views, that I should
		be sorry to see any child of mine marry so imprudently as to
		plunge into the sordid cares of life without consideration. Should
		misfortune bring poverty, and the Almighty try his creatures by
		affliction, how beautiful is it <em>then</em> to behold the exertions
		which the finest minds are capable of making when sustained by
		religious submission, and encouraged by fond affection; but to
		<em>place</em> ourselves <em>willingly</em> in situations which our strength may
		not prove sufficient to admit of our filling conscientiously, is
		to presume upon our own powers, and is therefore dangerous. You
		see then, my dear boy, that as far as my opinion may have weight,
		you are not to expect any accession to your worldly pride from
		the Douglas family, who are very unambitious people; and, though
		I trust that they will never 'disgrace you,' I fear that you must
		be contented
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
					 to love them for their <em>own</em> sakes, and not for any
		flattering unction to be derived through their future destiny.
		No, I hardly think it likely that Emily, Charlotte, or Fanny,
		will ever contribute their aid to a high-sounding paragraph in
		the newspapers; but I shall indeed be disappointed if they are
		satisfied with less than sense and affection, if they marry."
	</p>

	<p>
		"My dear aunt, you mistake me: as much sense as you like; and you
		cannot imagine that I could be such a barbarian as to fancy that
		any man who married one of my cousins should be so deficient in
		good taste as not to love her as well as men generally love their
		wives. Remember, that the happiest home of infancy must, in the
		course of nature, dissolve; and then what becomes of a luckless
		sisterhood of old maids, who, having suffered the spring and summer
		to pass by unheeded, in vain deplore their idle improvidence, and
		fret away the gloomy remnant of their days on earth in sourness and
		solitude?" "A dismal picture, indeed," replied my aunt, "I must
		try if I cannot draw one less dispiriting. In the first
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
																 place you
		acknowledge that, according to <em>your</em> scheme, sense and affection,
		though not <em>principals</em>, are useful <em>accessories</em>, and are to be
		taken as make-weights into the scale of happiness. Now my idea is,
		that this is to expect too much, and more than experience will
		realize, unless in some instance perhaps of extraordinary exception
		upon which we have no right to calculate. If you marry for rank,
		you <em>obtain</em> it, and should be satisfied with your bargain; if for
		fortune, you have gained your object, and must not complain: the
		contract is fair, though you receive only that for which you make
		your agreement; and it is quite unjust to suppose that perfections
		which you never sought, and qualities of which you never went in
		search, will be added to heap up your measure."
	</p>

	<p>
		"The happiest home of early life must in nature's course dissolve,
		you say: agreed; but, the affrighting scene of unavailing misery
		which you have painted, is not the necessary consequence of such
		an event. <em>I</em> can imagine three sisters who may not have been
		tempted to quit the paternal roof by meeting such congeniality
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
																	   of
		character as they deemed essential to happiness, living together as
		kindly in the decline, as in the meridian of life. I can imagine
		them to look abroad without envy, and at home without disgust.
		If excluded from some enjoyments which belong to another mode of
		existence, they are spared also many of the evils which attach to
		it, and with this advantage, that while the former are precarious,
		the latter are inevitable. The brightest anticipations founded on
		the most apparently stable foundation, may <em>possibly</em> deceive, but
		the physical suffering, and the anxious care which are inseparable
		from the maternal relation, are penalties from which there is no
		exemption. No bill of indemnity can set aside a mother's pangs;
		and be assured, that were women endowed with the gift of oracular
		foresight, and like the ancient Sybils capable of peeping into
		the cup of futurity, very few would have courage to taste the
		bitter draught which marriage too frequently mingles to allure by
		promises, and poison by disappointment. The fondest affection, the
		kindest support, and all the inestimable charms of sympathetic
		companionship,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
					   may indeed render the conjugal union an antepast
		of heaven; but such contracts of folly and avarice, as are but too
		often sealed in what you call the world, represent as truly a state
		of severest punishment; and between these extremes, a single lot
		is far to be preferred to the compromise which matrimony in its
		average of calculation <em>usually</em> exhibits. The great purposes of
		life are, however, fulfilled at the expense of individual ease,
		and many a spirit learns in the school of adversity, those blessed
		lessons of humility and dependence upon a Heavenly Father, that pay
		with such peace 'as the world can neither give nor take away' for
		the infliction of an earthly husband."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Well, my ears," said I, "are unaccustomed to such language. I
		confess it is no less new than surprising; yet that I may know the
		full extent of your deviation from modern creeds, perhaps you will
		describe the sort of helpmate to whose guardianship <em>you</em> would
		entrust a daughter?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Most willingly, Arthur. The peculiar temperament of each
		individual stamps an impress of its own upon the mind, and,
		according
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
				  to the variety of taste, will be our selection of
		such qualities in a friend, as harmonize with its distinctive
		character. Marriage has been eloquently described as 'the queen
		of friendships,' and yet the monarch fares less well than any of
		her subjects; and while the choice of a companion who is only to
		travel in our society for a few short miles upon the continent, is
		governed by kindred feeling and pursuits, the journey which is to
		end but with life, is undertaken upon the most flimsy ground of
		temporary whim or expediency. Is this rational, is it consistent
		conduct?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Then may I ask, my dear aunt, do you conceive it really necessary
		that two people must have learned the same arts, have studied
		the same sciences, and read the same books; spoken in the same
		languages, thought the same thoughts, and been in fact, like Helen
		and Hermia, 'a double cherry seeming parted, but yet a union in
		partition;' to make a reasonably happy, suitable jog-trot couple in
		the holy bands of wedlock?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Not entirely, though perhaps the more of such similarity the
		better; but Arthur, you asked for
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
										   a description, and you shall
		have one. After the great leading bond of sympathy upon religion
		and moral conduct, the <em>grain</em> of character is most essential to
		happiness in married life. There is a fineness of texture in some
		minds which cannot endure contact with what is coarse, any more
		than cambrick will bear being united to sail-cloth. The unequal
		tissue will give way, and the more delicate fabric will be torn to
		atoms. The mere matters of acquirement may differ without injury
		to affection, an interchange may take place, which shall borrow
		sweetness from its source; and even that which possessed no charms
		to invite its acquisition, may become delightful, if taught by, or
		studied for the sake of a being whom we love. I knew a lady whose
		husband was a barrister; they adored each other, but they were
		poor, and professional industry could not be dispensed with. Their
		mornings were necessarily passed in the performance of separate
		duties; but when the business of the day was over, and the evening
		hearth burned brightly as they sat together, a doubt would arise
		whether the most enchanting
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
									of all gratifications, each others'
		society, was not a luxury too great for <em>them</em>. The doubt ended
		in certainty, that law reading ought to supersede the charms of
		conversation, and what was the result? that affection was too
		powerful to be selfish, or rather <em>self</em> was extended to a second
		and a dearer object. The wife determined to convert a solitary and
		painful duty, into a social delight; she insisted on joining in
		her husband's study, and several of the driest and most difficult
		books were read aloud to each other in succession. The experiment
		answered to admiration. They were engaged <em>together</em>, and this was
		enough to make them happy. What was distasteful to one, and at
		first unintelligible to the other, became amusement; and in the
		morning's walk, were often discussed the cases which had occupied
		the previous afternoon. Memory was improved by this exercise: a
		little time enabled the lady still farther to share the fatigues
		of a beloved partner in noting his briefs, and assisting in other
		professional cares, rewarded by the delight of knowing that her
		presence was necessary to the happiness of him who
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
														   formed her own.
		Arthur, such is what <em>I</em> call affection, and such is my idea of
		companionship in wedded love."
	</p>

	<p>
		My heart glowed, and I could not speak; I gazed on my aunt: her
		cheek was slightly flushed, and her eyes had acquired the deep
		and clear expression which brought to my mind that exquisite
		description in the Prisoner of Chillon.
	</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<span class="i0">"The eye of most transparent light</span>
		<span class="i0">That almost made the dungeon bright."</span>
	</div>

	<p>
		We both paused: when, recovering from a momentry lapse of thought,
		she continued: "I knew another wife whose husband was employed for
		several years in various diplomatic trusts of high importance. He
		was an invalid, and frequently incapaciated from taking part in
		public affairs; but the faithful friend of his bosom who was a most
		admirable linguist, wrote his letters in five different tongues,
		and was supposed to be a native in them all. Can you match these
		instances of connubial tenderness and confidence in the frigid
		annals of fashion? Turn, my Arthur, from the heartless trammels,
		and dare to be free."
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
		"Such women," said I, "as you have represented, would soon
		revolutionize the world, and bring about a mighty change in the
		motives that influence marriage; but instances like these occur at
		intervals, just to shew us of what your sex is <em>capable</em>, and that
		is all."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Alas, Arthur," replied my aunt, "women rarely discover objects
		amongst men worthy of exciting powerful affection, and none but
		slaves will bestow the semblance where the reality does not
		exist. Men and women act and re-act reciprocally on each other's
		characters, and though exceptions may appear, you will find it
		easy in general to decide upon one sex, by the merits or demerits
		of the other, allowing for those differences between them which
		distinguishes each from its opposite."
	</p>

	<p>
		"How then," said I, "is a new order of things to be effected? <em>One</em>
		swallow does not make a summer.
	</p>

	<p>
		"The change would be achieved with-out any difficulty, my child,
		would each individual only throw off the artificial shackles which
		are imposed by opinion upon
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
									the heart and understanding. Nature
		is so lovely, truth so captivating, that one would <em>imagine</em> it no
		hard matter to disengage the mind from the bondage of a factitious
		yoke, and I return to their gentle empire. Yet this is all that we
		are called upon to do, and that only with <em>ourselves</em>. If our early
		years were passed in laying up store for futurity in practising the
		affections within the circle of those whom God has given to be our
		nearest and dearest ties, in cultivating intellect, and acquiring
		useful knowledge, we should need no farther security against the
		mistakes of after life. Religion, virtue, wisdom, and good taste,
		would be our guides as well as our protectors."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Aunt, 'almost thou persuadest me;' but you named religion, and
		before we conclude I must say a word upon that part of the subject."
	</p>

	<p>
		At this instant who should appear at the entrance of a moss-house,
		in which my aunt and I had been seated for the last half hour, but
		Oliphant, Charlotte, and Fanny? They had taken a round of the wood,
		and were returning when this <i xml:lang="fr">contre tems</i> took place. I blushed
		immoderately.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
					  It was such a topic to be caught in the act of
		discussing; but my confusion did not last long.
	</p>

	<p>
		What a blessing is <em>tact</em>! That monosyllable contains a volume. My
		aunt saw, I suppose, exactly all that was passing across my mind&mdash;
	</p>

	<p>
		"<i xml:lang="la">Caciata del core fuge nel volto</i>,"&mdash;and, instantly seizing on
		Charlotte's hand, she said, "My love, I want you and Fanny to run
		home and send the little car to me. I am a wee bit tired; I will
		keep Mr. Oliphant and Arthur here, till Paddy and poney arrive."
	</p>

	<p>
		Like lightning, the nymph disappeared, and, quietly turning to me
		as if our dialogue had suffered no interruption, "I am so glad that
		just as we wanted Mr. Oliphant, he has come to our aid," said my
		aunt. "He will be quite at home in answering your last question."
	</p>

	<p>
		She then in a moment playfully informed Domine of our single
		combat, "which," added she "was fairly fought, and rather
		favourably to my side at the close, till Arthur rallying his
		forces, to make a powerful stand, entrenched
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
													  himself under an
		authority to which, were it against me, I should implicitly submit;
		but I will now place <em>you</em> in my stead; and, as I am sure that
		Arthur was <em>going</em> to say (no <em>young</em> ladies being present) that
		female inferiority is supported by that volume, from which there is
		no appeal at Glenalta, I am not without hope that you will drive my
		nephew from this last fastness."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I accept the challenge," said Oliphant, "and thank you for the
		post which you allot to me, as the laurel of victory already
		circles round my brow; but I must hear my adversary state his case."
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus forced into a tilting match with the tutor, I laughed,
		and assured him that I had never presumed upon encountering so
		formidable an enemy; but as it would be a tacit confession that
		my cause was weak, were I to remain silent, "I must own," said I,
		"that Mrs. Douglas precisely hit upon what I was going to urge,
		namely, that however modern manners, to which my aunt discovers
		so little gratitude, have <em>raised</em> women to the pedestal on which
		they
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
			 stand, the Bible tells a different tale; and were it even
		true that female pride had got a fall through fashion's fiat, would
		not such depreciation be exact conformity with holy writ?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Were it so," answered the <em>giant</em> of learning, "Mrs. Douglas
		would neither lament nor contend against her fate, but the Bible
		is peculiarly her sanctuary of refuge, from which, when driven to
		its sacred shelter by the taunts of the world, she might proudly
		exclaim, 'it was not thus, when we came from the hands of God.'"
	</p>

	<p>
		"No, my dear sir, man was created in God's own image; 'male and
		female created he them.' Eve (the meaning of which word is life)
		was formed after, and <em>out of</em> man. She was not given to him as
		property, but given 'to be with him,' as a companion, because he
		would have been a cheerless, as also a useless animal without
		her. The original Hebrew implies no superiority, nor inferiority.
		Adam and Eve were the counterparts of each other. Eve was bone
		of bone, flesh of flesh, to her husband, <em>both</em> endowed with
		immortality, <em>both</em> invested with rule over all creatures of the
		earth. The word woman is from the Hebrew <i xml:lang="he">Ish</i>, signifying man,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
		which, when simply altered by two letters to <i xml:lang="he">Ishau</i>, literally
		means she-man. <i xml:lang="he">Andris</i> is the female form of <i xml:lang="he">Aner</i>, man, in the
		Greek; and in Arabic we have <i xml:lang="he">Imrat</i>, she-man, from <i xml:lang="he">Imree</i>, man.
		Every man should consider woman as a part of himself; and when,
		as a punishment for her disobedience, the heavy denunciation was
		issued that Eve should be subject to her <em>husband</em>, it was not
		required by their Maker that she should resign any part of that
		understanding, any prerogative of heart or intellect, which had
		originally been bestowed, when she was formed his equal in power.
		Both man and woman were deprived of immortality. Death came into
		the world with sin, and with <em>these</em>, woman's legal bondage to
		her <em>husband</em>; but beyond this limit you cannot proceed. On the
		contrary, though the brutal habits of eastern tyranny debased the
		sex, to which inferior bodily strength had been from the first
		communicated, yet was it exalted in the moment of depression by Him
		who called it into being, and inflicted the curse. The woman was to
		bruise the serpent's head. She was
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
										   the first destroyer, and was
		permitted to be the first in the chain of restoration, by being the
		appointed medium, the <em>sole</em> earthly parent of the Saviour. When
		Abraham was entitled Father of the faithful, Sarah received like
		honour, and was named their Mother; and when our blessed Lord came
		upon earth, from one end to the other of his ministry, there is
		not a syllable to be found derogatory of the female sex. He loved
		Mary as a sister; and upon various occasions distinguished certain
		women by particular expressions of affectionate approbation. There
		is no authority in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation for the
		opinion that you hold; and with respect to punishment inflicted by
		Deity for transgression, a generous feeling would naturally suggest
		the desire of lightening rather than aggravating its infliction,
		especially when we reflect that the only difference between the
		culprits lay in the measure of delinquency. Adam and his sons have
		no cause of triumph; and I never read the story of the fall without
		considering with humiliation the first proof afforded of a lowered
		nature in our common progenitor, when to save himself from the
		principal condemnation, he
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
								   selfishly consigned his partner to the
		wrath of offended divinity. When our Saviour arose from the dead,
		it was to his faithful female followers that he first revealed
		himself; and, as a concluding remark, permit me to observe, that
		if, as we are assured unequivocally, women are equal inheritors of
		the skies, it ill befits us to refuse them their rights on earth.
		No, sir, depend upon it, when men cannot support themselves, except
		by asserting that power which the laws have conferred upon them,
		they are <em>hard run</em>, and the edifice is tottering when it requires
		a buttress. The nobler animals are all <em>quiescent</em>. The lion
		reposes in his strength, and knowing how much he can command, is
		slow at making exhibition of his force; but "man, proud man!"

		"I remember, sir," said I, "to have seen once, in the library of a
		gentleman, who, by the bye, was a most complete domestic despot, an
		odd sort of a book, entitled "Rights of Women."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Are you acquainted with, and an approver of that work?"&mdash;"No,
		young gentleman, that is a book which has long ago found its
		resting-place amid dust and cobwebs. When new, it was a wretched
		thing, and is now forgotten; but you found it, as the mineralogists
		express themselves, <i xml:lang="la">in situ</i>, when you discovered a stray copy on
		the shelves of a tyrant. The brawlers about liberty are generally
		fond of keeping it all to themselves. The French revolution, which
		was before your time, set many heads distracted, and loosened
		the whole frame-work of our morals; but we are sobered, and have
		consigned to oblivion the grosser absurbities of that disjointed
		period.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Women have real and substantial rights, natural as well as civil,
		which no one attempts to dispute; and they are fools when they part
		with them, unless to secure a greater good than they relinquish;
		but marriage is the rock upon which multitudes make shipwreck,
		because from the present constitution of things, that solemn act
		of life is performed with less consideration than people commonly
		employ in the purchase
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
							   of a field. Men, after a career of folly,
		begin to look about them, and think it wise to <em>settle</em>, before
		time has thinned their locks and scattered silver over the flowing
		honours of youth. Women sigh for what are called establishments;
		and happiness slides out of a scheme in which no provision has been
		made for its entertainment. Take an old man's advice, Mr. Howard,
		be as deliberate in your selection as you please, and I hope that
		you will not marry till you know your own mind; but when you <em>do</em>
		become a Benedick, let your Beatrice be the friend of your bosom,
		the companion of your life, and a partner in all your pains,
		pleasures, and pursuits."
	</p>

	<p>
		I was not prepared to contradict, for the truth is, that Domine
		told me more in half a dozen sentences than I ever heard before.
		However, not to appear as if I had suddenly lost <em>my speech</em>, I
		gently hinted, "that Solomon was usually thought a wise man, upon
		the authority of the Scriptures; and he declares that, in his
		search after wisdom, he had never found <em>one</em> woman to reward his
		pains."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Truly, that is not very wonderful," said Oliphant. "When the men,
		who possessed all
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
						  the advantages that superior power bestowed,
		made so little use of it towards the cultivation of knowledge
		and virtue, that Solomon complains of not finding a man of worth
		in <em>a thousand</em>, no wonder that amongst the weaker sex, who were
		kept in the lowest state of slavery and degradation, he should
		not discover any who, deprived of the benefit of education, and
		shut out from the light of truth, had broken her bonds, and soared
		above the horrible debasement to which females were condemned by
		their rulers. The Christian Religion, of which that Bible that
		you lately quoted as authority for the servitude of women, is the
		sacred repository, is in fact the charter of female liberty; and
		in proportion as the Sun of Righteousness shines with more or less
		refulgence in any land, in such proportion is woman respected."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Pray then, Mr. Oliphant, how comes it that the sense of mankind
		has always been taking a contrary course? A boy is hardly out of
		his nurse's arms, before he hears of his superiority over his
		sisters. When he goes to school, the first grammar that his lisping
		tongue is turned to repeat, tells him that his sex is most worthy.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
		In the <em>world</em>, one hears women only estimated by their beauty,
		or their wealth; and in families we see them nothing better than
		the wrecks of a former day, little loved by their husbands, or
		respected by their children."
	</p>

	<p>
		"<i xml:lang="la">Hinc illæ lachrymæ</i>," answered my opponent, "in <em>one</em> sense
		the male sex is decidedly superior&mdash;I mean in strength; and were
		this employed in supporting the weak, instead of oppressing them,
		the female world would not be disposed to grudge men a supremacy
		of which they would themselves enjoy the happy fruits. But as to
		your nursery nonsense, an elder son is always told that he is as
		much above his younger brothers, as his sisters; and so he is,
		by the laws of primogeniture, which give him the estate. Yet I
		suppose that there are few such blockheads as to believe, that
		because a man happens to come into the world before his brethren,
		he is therefore invested with a patent of superior intellectual
		endowment. On the contrary, it often happens, that elder sons,
		satisfied with the gifts of fortune, take little trouble with their
		minds, and are, in point of cultivation,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
												 at the <em>tail</em> instead
		of the <em>head</em> of their Houses. Grammar rules prove nothing. They
		were made by <em>men</em>, and according to vulgar estimates of physical
		force; and as <em>to the world</em>, the most convincing proof in my eyes
		of its degeneracy in our day, is to be found in the impertinent
		neglect of women, so frequently observable in the <i xml:lang="fr">soi-disant</i> men
		of fashion. To sum up the argument: the sexes differ from each
		other, but <em>difference</em> implies nothing of better or worse, taller
		or shorter, wiser or less wise. They are <em>different</em>, and each
		beautifully adapted by the eternal Creator to fulfil the purposes
		for which it was designed. The man stronger, more active&mdash;made to
		encounter danger, and endure fatigue. The woman more delicate,
		more refined, formed to sooth by her tenderness, to watch over the
		helpless, comfort the unfortunate, and be the balm of human kind.
		In mental capacity Nature has dealt with impartial bounty, and the
		most splendid talents are to be found in that sex, which I grieve
		to add, too rarely exercise their powers. Rely upon it, that men
		are not less manly for sharing
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
									   their privileges, nor women less
		feminine for profiting by the boon. The age of Chivalry is gone,

		"Look, my dear young gentleman, around you at Glenalta. Is
		Frederick less likely to attain the gold medal at his University,
		or is he less ardent in pursuit of game in the fields, because he
		loves his mother and sisters, and would be unwilling to enjoy any
		gratification in which they were not partakers? Turn your eyes
		upon the dear gentle trio of your fair cousins, and tell me are

		I was going to say something, I hardly know what, when a party
		appeared in sight, that at a little distance might have passed
		for a group of gipsies; Paddy and the poney car, led the van.

		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
		salutations, I could not help remarking the anxiety of all
		the young people about my aunt, whose expression of fatigue had
		brought them back to offer aid, and satisfy themselves that she
		was not ill. Frederick settled the cushions, and dispatched Paddy,
		saying, that he must himself drive the little car, lest it should
		go too fast. Fanny had brought a small basket, in which was a phial
		of hartshorn, and a glass having been also produced, away ran
		Charlotte to the stream which tumbles through this rocky glen, to
		procure water,&mdash;all without <em>fuss</em>, or effort.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yes, there is no question of it&mdash;what Oliphant says is true enough.
		These people are not at all the worse for any thing that they have
		said, done, learned, or acquired. My aunt was unusually gay, to
		convince her children that nothing ailed her; and we all returned
		home, laughing and talking as merrily as possible. Bentley was
		asked to stay and dine, which Phil. had promised also to do, and so
		sped Saturday away as smoothly as if it <em>rolled</em> on <em>casters</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the evening we walked. I took my first lesson in botany from
		Emily. We planned a
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
							 trip to Killarney, for July, if my aunt makes
		no objection, and finished the <em>revels</em> with music.
	</p>

	<p>
		What would you think, if I tell you, that Domine took the bass in
		several glees, and has a remarkably fine sonorous voice. Our guests
		departed. The bell rang. Servants were assembled, and the usual
		prayer was read, with no other circumstance of change, than the
		substitution of Mr. Oliphant, in quality of domestic chaplain, for
		my aunt.
	</p>

	<p>
		Just as we were about to separate, Fanny called me, and whispered,
		"Don't go yet to your room. We are going to hold a conference for
		a few minutes in the study, and you must assist at our council." I
		accordingly lagged behind, and after Mr. Oliphant and my aunt had
		severally retired, <em>we</em> five mustered in the Library. Emily opened
		the proceedings, by saying, "Arthur, my brother, sisters and I,
		have set our hearts upon accomplishing a project which Frederick
		and I devised in our walk this evening. It is to prevail with our
		beloved mother to accompany us to Killarney. It is <em>many</em> years
		since she has been there, and I know that she
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
													   will not revisit
		that heavenly spot without the deepest emotion. Yet we cannot
		help flattering ourselves with its being of such a nature as not
		to amount to pain; and it will be counteracted by the pleasure of
		beholding our rapture at seeing her make one in our excursion.
		Phil. is in our secret, and <em>now</em> so are you. We are going to
		write a petition. She shall not have it to-night, because it might
		agitate her; and it shall only be signed by her children, because
		if such happiness as her compliance would impart, should be in
		store for us, it is of that sacred character which we could not
		bear to owe even to the dearest friends; and if, on the other hand,
		as I am afraid may prove the case, we are asking too much, we
		will not involve any one else in the pain of a refusal. Now good
		night&mdash;wish us success, and meet us in the moss-house at eight in
		the morning to learn our fate."
	</p>

	<p>
		I went to my room quite unable to speak&mdash;I was suffocating, and,
		<em>shall</em> I confess to Falkland (but proclaim it not in Gath) tears,
		such as I never shed before in all my life, coursed each other down
		my "innocent nose." It is too much.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
											Unmanned at a short turn, and
		by what? a set of children laying schemes to have their mother's
		company in a party of pleasure! Well, I know not what is to come
		next, but this place will be the ruin of me, if this is the way
		in which I go on resigning my understanding. Positively I shall
		be absolutely unfit for society, and look when I go back to town
		precisely as if I had been spending a couple of months with Noah in
		the ark, and had just stepped out on Mount Ararat. I took myself to
		task; shook myself; scolded myself; chewed the cud of the last ball
		at Almack's; ditto at Lady Arabella Huntley's; placed myself in the
		midst of that group with whom I passed my last London evening at
		Lady Murray's after the Opera; but it would not do.
	</p>

	<p>
		When the mind gets one of these <em>wrenches</em>, it is in vain to
		attempt setting matters to rights again in a hurry. I found, after
		toiling to give a new bent to my reflections, that they would
		still return with elastic force to the place whence they set out;
		and I therefore gave vent to them in the new course which they
		had channelled for themselves. While in this mood, I
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
															  could not
		help thinking, that if we measure life by the exercise of our
		faculties, and the warmth of our feelings, instead of by such
		evidences of existence as might apply to stocks and stones as well
		as to sentient beings, I have only <em>lived</em> in your society, and
		since I came to Glenalta. A mournful chill stole over my heart as
		I involuntarily asked myself, "Is my mother like <em>this</em> mother,
		or are my sisters like my cousins?" These questions led me to one
		still more immediately painful&mdash;"Do I resemble Frederick?" The
		inquiry was accompanied by a feeling of such bitterness, that I
		fear it must have been answered in the negative, to each of my
		self-addressed queries. Alas! thought I, of what light materials
		are we formed! tossed about by every wind, and seizing on the
		contagion of every new situation! Well, one week has worked a
		strange <em>jumble</em> of my tastes and opinions, but all will be
		<em>stratified</em> in regular order, according to received notions, by a
		corresponding term, when I revisit Selby or Grosvenor Square. This
		consolation seemed a <i xml:lang="la">quietus</i>, for I fell asleep, and undisturbed
		by farther moralizing, rose refreshed and
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
												  full of spring, in due
		season to keep my engagement.
	</p>

	<p>
		What a vein of lovely weather! and what an influence does it exert
		over our souls. The morning appeared as if determined to cheat me
		into good humour with all the wearisome business of Sunday in "a
		pious family" (oh that quaint expression) in the country. Nature
		looked as if she had just stepped, in the luxuriance of youth and
		beauty, that moment from her bath. A dew-drop glistened on every
		blade of grass, and fragrance breathed around from every flower. I
		set out with that invigorating sensation of hilarity which I have
		always found an early walk on a fine day to produce. I believe,
		that besides the animal gratification arising from sunshine,
		perfumes, and the bracing quality of fresh air, we are insensibly
		pleased with ourselves, when we have started from the enervating
		effects of drowsy slumbers, and snatched a portion of time from
		Lethe's wave.
	</p>

	<p>
		I was in the humour to analyze, and I think that I was more
		complacent in my feelings towards <em>myself</em> than usual. If so, it
		is not hard to
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
					   account for the <em>balminess</em> of charity towards
		all things else&mdash;the key-note is ever to be found within our own
		breasts, and it regulates the whole strain.
	</p>

	<p>
		Half-musing, half-poetizing, I reached the moss-house, and was
		ruminating on the sparkling stream that dashes over the rock,
		amongst its tangled brush-wood, when with light feet, my nymphs and
		their brother hastened round the wood, and appeared at the seat of
		Congress.
	</p>

	<p>
		After a joyous "good morrow," they told me that "mamma" had not
		been awake when they left the house to attend the Sunday School,
		and therefore they had no good news to impart to me; and only came
		to the place of appointment, lest I should wait and accuse them of
		a failure in punctuality.
	</p>

	<p>
		The words "Sunday School," acted as a "killing frost" to all the
		tender leaves and buds with which Fanny had wreathed my morning
		walk, and looking I dare say like an icicle, I said, "And are you
		<em>really</em> enlisted amongst those troops of godly women dressed in
		grey, and looking like flocks of Solon geese, who paddle
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
																 from
		house to house on the Sabbath, and make that which was given us for
		an anniversary of repose, the most tiresome and laborious day of
		all the weekly seven?" My companions laughed, and Frederick bade me
		not be alarmed, assuring me that there were no Solon geese in the
		poultry-yard of Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		"We do not belong," said Emily, "to a <em>train-band</em> of any
		description; and a very short portion of Sunday is sufficient
		for our little task. But few children assemble at our school, as
		Protestants are thinly scattered in Kerry; and, as it is a rule
		here, never to teach to read where the Bible is not received, the
		number of our scholars is very limited. This would be subject of
		grief to mamma, were it not her fixed opinion, supported by the
		experience and strong sense of our friend Mr. Otway, and the worthy
		tutor, that in <em>this</em> country matters are not ripe for the quantity
		of education forced upon the people, and that a more gradual
		process is for the advantage of every part of the community; but
		were it otherwise, our individual labours would still be light.
		Charlotte, Fanny, and I,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
								 go before breakfast to hear the children
		read a chapter, repeat a collect, and answer a few questions, more
		as <em>pioneers</em> to Mr. Oliphant, than as teachers. This occupies
		only one hour, and we do no more. Domine, as you call him, and the
		Curate of our parish, who is a very good clergy-man, examine after
		church, and this finishes the school-work of the day."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Bless me!" said I, "I am very glad to hear these things, but must
		own that your account is most unexpected. The ladies whom I have
		heard called 'pious,' at our post town in Buckinghamshire, sit up,
		I imagine, all Saturday night, and starve all Sunday. They defile
		along in troops, looking sour enough to curdle milk into whey by
		their presence, and are always to be seen loaded with tracts, and
		carrying bags which are filled with other implements of the trade.
		These saintly damsels are, I firmly believe, a set of whale-boned
		exclusionists, who deny salvation to all who are not within their
		pale, and able to answer their <i xml:lang="la">qui va là?</i> by the signs and
		countersigns of their free masonry."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Arthur," replied Emily, "though your
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
											  anger diverts, I must
		scold you for being too severe. Why should you judge so hardly
		upon hearsay testimony of people whom it is your boast not to be
		acquainted with? Surely starving, without food or rest by day,
		and sleep at night, cannot be matter of <em>amusement</em>; and if your
		picture be not greatly exaggerated, we may at least hope that the
		motives are pure, which dictate so much self-denial."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Not a bit of it, I assure you," answered I. "I promise you that
		these folks are self-sufficient, as they are generally weak; and
		have as much pride, vanity, and dogmatism, in their own <em>plain</em>
		way, as their neighbours. They set up to be teachers, when they
		would be much better employed in learning; and both men and women
		of the new light get into the cant, and are sworn in to the
		confederacies to serve very secular purposes. See how they nestle
		into the houses of the great, marry the best fortunes, and while
		they preach a religious republic, always take care if they can, to
		secure the dictatorship."
	</p>

	<p>
		"We know nothing here of these abuses,"
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
												said Emily; "I have
		heard of noble characters who devote all their time, money, and
		influence, to the high purposes of reclaiming the vicious, and
		teaching the Word of God to the ignorant. But if we lived in a
		less refined spot than this, we should not even then be likely to
		join any of the societies to which you allude, composed of such
		as are technically, and most improperly called, when with design
		to convey a <em>taunt</em>, 'good people.' Mamma dislikes <em>liveries</em>,
		whether of dress or manners. She disapproves of bazaars, working
		parties, and all religious exhibitions and excitements: in short,
		of all demonstrations of what she calls a <em>gregarious</em> spirit of
		piety; though she makes it a point never to express an opinion in
		the presence of any one who could wrest it to the unworthy purpose
		of throwing either ridicule or reproach on numbers of excellent
		persons of both sexes who differ from her in theory as well as
		practice."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I perceive," said I, with delight, "that my aunt does not consider
		dancing a sin."&mdash;"No, so far from it," answered Frederick, "that
		when the Sandfords were with us, we were very gay,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
														   and I hope
		shall be so again when they return in the autumn. My mother loves
		that piety should rear her altar in the heart, and does not
		rest so much as some well meaning people are inclined to do, on
		petty observances of a merely external kind. She cannot endure
		<em>mannerism</em>, and her feelings are very strong upon the injury which
		true religion sustains through want of judgment in her votaries.
		The tithe of mint, anise, and cummin, occupies many, perhaps not
		to the entire <em>exclusion</em> of weightier matters; but <em>little</em>
		things can be understood, and grasped by minds totally incapable
		of enlarged views; and unfortunately these are often mistaken for
		vital principles, when they are no more than sign-posts. For this
		reason, the peculiar language which has become so common, is never
		used here; and though Sunday at Glenalta is a very sacred day, I
		hope that you will not find it more dull than other days."
	</p>

	<p>
		As Fred. ceased to speak, who should enter our council chamber but
		my aunt. "What! all my dears assembled in committee?" "Yes, dearest
		mother," said Frederick, springing forward
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
												   to meet her, "and with
		Arthur in the chair, we have passed a resolution, that you will
		make us the happiest group in Christendom, if you will grant the
		boon implored in this petition." So saying, he slipped a paper into
		her hand, and taking two of his sisters, leaving Fanny to grace
		my arm, he added, "we must not take our sovereign by surprise.
		She must have time to <em>dwell</em> upon the prayer of her subjects. So
		we will make a tour of St. Colman's rock, and be back like true
		liegemen, to assist her in returning home." Off he hurried us, and
		this was done to spare his mother that emotion which is always
		felt when we know that what passes within the heart is seen and
		comprehended by others. It is astonishing! These young people study
		every look, and can follow the windings, however sinuous, of every
		thought, when affection is the lamp to guide their way.
	</p>

	<p>
		We took the round of St. Colman, a great white rock, about which,
		there is a legend, that perhaps I may tell you at some other time,
		and found my aunt seated where we left her: probably pondering
		upon past happiness, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
								 present gratitude, for blessings still
		continued. Her <em>own</em> sweet smile rested on her countenance, but
		a tear had recently fallen on her cheek. She did not wait to be
		addressed, but extending a hand to Fred. and his eldest sister,
		told them by a beaming, but silent look, that she complied with
		their entreaty. Fred. seized her in his arms in extacy, and having
		given one emphatic kiss, which bore a world of thanks upon its
		impress, he dashed out of the moss-house, unable to control the
		feeling of his manly heart. He is a fine creature. Emily and
		Charlotte glided away without uttering a word, and Fanny sobbed
		aloud. Her mother kissed her, and taking my arm, with a tremulous
		voice that seemed to struggle against display of those inward
		conflicts which caused it to falter, said to me, "dear Arthur, you
		are unused to scenes like this in fashionable life, yet they are
		very sweet. Like Cornelia, I have my jewels, and they are precious
		gems; but we shall be late, and Mr. Oliphant will wonder what has
		become of his congregation." I felt again the plaguy <em>choke</em>, which
		is an endemic, I suppose of these
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
										  bogs, for I have scarcely ever
		experienced a fit of the disease till I came here. I could not help
		giving a gentle <em>squeeze</em> to the hand that leaned upon my arm. "You
		are the happiest set I ever saw," said I. A suppressed sigh met
		my ear, and Fanny, jumping into the middle of the walk, to arrest
		our progress, broke a chain which would have led to sorrow. "Oh!
		mamma, stop: Arthur, don't put down your right foot for your life.
		There, now he's safe poor thing," and in an instant, a frightful
		frog, which had been hurt by some unlucky foot that had come down
		too weightily on the reptile's leg, was gently deposited, first on
		her hand, and then laid quietly on the grass under the shade of a
		Lauristinus. "I will return after breakfast," muttered Fan. "and if
		I find that you are not likely to recover, poor little wretch, you
		shall be put out of your pain by old Lorry." How my sisters would
		stare in wild amaze, were I to tell them of such an act! "Pray,"
		said I, "Fanny, do you cherish in this manner, all the vile vermin
		that chance brings into your path?" "To be sure; every creature can
		live its short
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
					   hour in pleasure or in pain; and the less pretty
		and likely to excite sympathy, the more I feel to be its friend:
		it is so pleasant to be kind to any thing that is unfortunate.
		These little traits let you into whole regions of character, and
		therefore it is that I relate them. You are very near the end of
		my <em>sketches</em>, and must then be contented with letters that sum
		up events; but I will not relax the labours of my <em>pencil</em>, to
		commence upon those of my <em>pen</em>, till you have Sunday sent down the
		stream of time, with the years before the flood."
	</p>

	<p>
		Oliphant, who had not any <em>starch</em> whatever in his features, met
		us at the verandah, without his hat, and looking as benign as the
		sky that he seemed to have stood admiring, before we reached the
		door. He helped my aunt to take off her shawl, and then presenting
		his arm, led the way towards the little room which serves as
		a chapel, where the only addition to the usual orisons, was a
		short and emphatic prayer for a blessing upon the employments and
		instruction, whether public or private, of this day. Breakfast
		ended, we soon set out to church, which is
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
												   full a mile distant;
		but the fineness of the weather tempted most of the party to walk.
		My aunt and Emily accompanied Mr. Otway in his carriage; and young
		Bentley, who is on a visit at Lisfarne, joined <em>us</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Arrived at the parish church, upon the side of a bleak and barren
		hill, I looked with amazement at the poverty of all around, not
		that there was an absence of decency, or even comfort; but the
		bare white-washed walls, the simple uncarved pulpit, unfringed
		cushions, with the absence of monumental decoration, music, and
		all the paraphernalia of church worship on our civilized side of
		the channel, struck me most unfavourably as I entered the family
		pew; but these things were soon forgotten, and the service was
		admirably performed. It so happened, that a gentleman who was on
		his way to some other part of the country, and whose talents as
		as a preacher stand deservedly high, had halted the day before at
		our parson's house, and was prevailed upon to take the pulpit.
		Mr. Oliphant, whose voice is well modulated, and whose devotion
		communicates a kindred feeling to his
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
											  auditors, read the lessons,
		and prepared the mind, by the simple energy of his manner, for the
		powerful impression which awaited it. The sermon was upon prayer,
		and described the efficacy of supplication for divine mercy and
		assistance. The preacher, who perhaps I may never see again, has
		left an indelible impression upon my mind. He was tall, thin, and
		pale, with a wonderful benevolence of aspect. A holy calm sat
		upon all his features, which the serene but clear light of his
		eye distinguished completely from the dulness of vanity. There
		was nothing monotonous in the repose of his appearance; and when
		he opened his lips, the effect was of music spoken. To the finest
		voice I ever heard, he added the perfection of its adaptation to
		every variety of meaning which his matter was designed to convey,
		and while every inflection seemed to be suited to the words which
		it uttered with such correspondence of expression, that had <em>they</em>
		been removed echo would still have given back all they could
		have imparted; <em>study</em> was the last idea that suggested itself
		in listening to this eloquent being. All his tones,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
															each look,
		each emphasis, appeared to be the spontaneous drapery in which a
		bright understanding clothed the feelings of his heart. I never
		was so transfixed in my life, and the apostolic sacredness of his
		figure harmonized so entirely with the simplicity of that lowly
		building divested of even the common-place decoration usual in
		English country churches, that for some time I was untrue to our
		beloved <em>Gothic</em>, and actually began to fancy that I had never till
		yesterday been amongst the faithful worshippers of God in His own
		Temple.
	</p>

	<p>
		When the sermon was finished, the preacher remained in his pulpit,
		apparently desirous of allowing the congregation to disperse before
		his departure; and we saw no more of him.
	</p>

	<p>
		The family of Glenalta had heard frequently of his extraordinary
		powers, but till now had never had an opportunity of judging for
		themselves. As we walked home, our talk by the wayside naturally
		enough took its hue from the scene which we had just quitted, and
		I asked Mr. Oliphant whether Mr. Leighton, whose performance had
		excited such general admiration,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
										 held the opinions distinctively
		denominated Calvinistic? "No, I should imagine not; but cannot
		speak positively, as I am not personally acquainted with him."
		Young Bentley, who was a little behind us, stepped up, and said, "I
		believe that I may answer with <em>certainty</em>; for an uncle of mine,
		who lives in the north, is very intimate with Mr. Leighton, and
		once asked him the question, from having heard some reports which
		were circulated touching the doctrines that he inculcated; and he
		entered upon that occasion into a full statement of his sentiments,
		which, to sum up briefly, may I fancy be comprised in two words,
		Gospel truth. He professed the most perfect charity for those who
		sincerely differ from him; and likewise the deepest admiration
		for holiness both of life and character, in some of those writers
		who held the peculiar tenets that mark Calvin's creed: but he
		unequivocally declared that he did not adopt the Genevan opinions,
		while he as unhesitatingly asserted his belief in evangelical
		piety as the only vital religion." "Pray," said I, "tell me what
		you mean; for with <em>us</em> evangelical
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
												 preachers are synonymous
		with Calvinists." "Aye," said Mr. Oliphant, "and probably with
		Methodists too: there is nothing so easy as a <em>name</em> by which
		people are in the habit of representing things not understood
		or inquired into? I once knew a young man who, being met in the
		street by another who had known him at the university, was suddenly
		asked, 'Why, Dick, when did you turn Calvinist?' My young friend
		stared, and the other flippantly added, 'I heard that you never
		dance now, and therefore suppose you to be one of the new light.'
		In this way, idleness and folly make sad confusion; but to answer
		<em>your</em> question, as to differences between certain opinions, I
		will put a volume into your hands, whenever you please, which will
		give you in detail the points upon which Calvin dissented from the
		Lutheran doctrines, and formed a sect now known by his name. Very
		many individuals are called Calvinists in the unthinking manner
		which I have described, without being in reality such; and many who
		incontrovertibly held Calvin's opinions, and others who do hold
		them at the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
					present day, have been, and are, men whose virtues
		ought to excite our deepest veneration, and inspire an earnest
		desire of imitation; however we may consider them mistaken in their
		explanation of those parts of the Bible which <em>appear</em> to sanction
		their doctrines. A pure evangelical faith embraces all that seems
		necessary to salvation, namely, the most perfect self-abasement
		before God, together with a lively sense of human unworthiness,
		full implicit confidence in the free gift of atoning mercy as the
		only way to everlasting glory, and an earnest desire, by increasing
		holiness and obedience, to prove ourselves the children of God.
		These principles, with the addition of a clear sense that we must
		<em>adopt</em> them, and become, through the divine spirit infused into
		our souls, awakened from the delusive securities of natural pride,
		and humbled by an abiding consciousness of our sins and infirmity,
		constitute a summary of the Christian system, and comprise all that
		is essentially evangelical."
	</p>

	<p>
		"I observed nothing," said I, "of peculiar phraseology in Mr.
		Leighton's discourse, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
								  certainly never heard any language more
		entirely free than is his from that <em>twang</em> which I have hitherto
		considered as a characteristic of the ultras in religion." "Now, my
		young friend," replied Domine, "are you not falling yourself into
		the error which you reprobate? Why use those words, which designate
		a sect of fashionable fault-finders, who rail against a religion
		which they do not take the trouble to investigate, just as plainly
		as the terms that you are desirous to abolish, mark what you call
		the new light fraternity?"
	</p>

	<p>
		I told him that I stood corrected, and he shook my hand, saying, "I
		thank you for so kindly excusing me in thus abruptly calling you
		to order;" and then continued&mdash;"Mr. Leighton is a person of such
		character, that my conclusion respecting his not being a Calvinist
		was drawn entirely from the absence of those expressions generally
		belonging to the school." "But, sir," said Mr. Bentley, "I have
		heard several sermons preached by men whose principles I discovered
		at a <em>short turn</em> now and then to be really Calvinistic, though
		they were free
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
					   from every peculiarity of phrase, and so guarded
		as to doctrine, that for a long time I have resisted the idea of
		their being any other than evangelical ministers of the gospel,
		such as you described it to be." "Aye," answered Oliphant, "that
		is the very point to which I would draw your attention. It is, in
		my opinion, not right to consider any tenet of a particular creed
		essential to salvation, and yet <em>suppress</em> it. Either the <i xml:lang="la">decretum
		horribile</i> is, or is not, a vital article: If not, there is no
		Calvinism, and if it be, no man who believes in its importance
		as a pillar of faith is justified by motives of <em>expediency</em> in
		leaving out subjects so essential in <em>their</em> view of the Christian
		system. A practical evil which I have known to proceed from what is
		commonly called a <em>judicious</em> style of preaching is, that many are
		taken in to become members of a congregation before they are aware
		of the tenets of their instructor. Much confusion of mind sometimes
		results. Weak understandings are perplexed, and the effect is,
		that people who are not capable of drawing nice distinctions, at
		last slide gradually, without any exercise of their own
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
																 will or
		understanding, into the opinions very different from those of
		which they <em>imagine</em> themselves to be the advocates. But, my dear
		Mr. Howard, we should each in his own sphere, be it narrow or
		extended, rejoice in all the good that exists, though it may vary
		in its livery; and, so far from cultivating a spirit of ridicule,
		endeavour to draw the bonds of charity together, so as to include
		all the <em>sincere</em> and pains-taking of the Christian community,
		within its ample scope."
	</p>

	<p>
		We were now arrived at the house, and separated into little
		parties. My aunt and her daughters disappeared, Mr. Oliphant and
		young Bentley went off to the school, and Fred. and I took a
		long and delightful walk <i xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i> by the sea side. We had a
		great deal of conversation that informed me of many particulars
		respecting my family, with which I had never till then been made
		acquainted. On returning home, as we passed a cabin door, I saw
		Fanny busily distributing bread and money, the former from a large
		basket held by the same boy who attends the donkies, and the
		latter
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
			   from a small leather bag which she carried slung upon her
		arm. "What are you doing here?" was answered by "nothing but our
		Sunday-work;" which, being interpreted, meant a weekly donation
		presented by these amiable girls to a few old people who cannot
		work, and who esteem the gift tenfold for being communicated by
		the hands of their young mistresses. This is a <em>striking</em> feature
		in the poor of this island. In England, a shilling is a shilling
		provided it come legitimately from the mint, no matter who is the
		donor; but here sentiment, which with us is confined to the higher
		classes, is to be found in the most miserable habitations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Charlotte, who was within the hut, joined our party, and told us
		that a poor man had just been expressing to her feelings which
		certainly are not common in any rank of life. She had said,
		"<em>Tim.</em>, why are you not walking to-day; it is too fine weather
		to stay in the house?" and his answer was, "The finer the day, my
		dear miss, the more I'd covet not to be looking
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
														at it; ever since
		I buried <em>her</em>, I'd rather be to myself, and Sunday brings all the
		people out." What an artless expression of faithful affection! This
		man's wife, who is the "<em>her</em>" to be comprehended, he supposes, by
		every one, because there is no other to confound with the image in
		his own breast, has been dead for six years; and yet Memory is true
		to her trust. There is something very endearing in this tenderness,
		and we feel in good humour with our species, when an instance
		like what I have mentioned occurs, to prove that some of our best
		movements can spring from an uncultivated soil.
	</p>

	<p>
		At dinner, after dinner, and all the evening, I am compelled in
		honesty to say, that not a moment passed heavily. We laughed and
		talked as usual. The interval between dinner and tea was spent in
		walking; that between tea and nine o'clock in listening to some of
		Handel's finest songs, very sweetly performed; and e'er "the close
		of the silent eve," the family group were once more assembled;
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
																	   and
		after prayers, and a short but impressive sermon, sent to their
		rest with an emphatic blessing.
	</p>

	<p>
		You have now the panorama of Glenalta, and you are placed upon
		a platform in the midst, from which, turning yourself round the
		scene, you can form a just idea of every object which it includes
		within the circuit.
	</p>

	<p>
		Thus have I brought (I believe with fidelity) the first part of my
		epistolary labours to a conclusion. From this time forth you will
		know all the <em>ground-plan</em>, and be enabled to allot its own place
		to each occurrence as it may chance to arise. As to the general
		impression made upon my mind, I own to you that I never was so
		happy anywhere as since I came to this lone and lovely spot; and
		I am powerfully struck with the truth of a remark which you once
		made to me, and which at that time though I had a vague idea of
		your being right, I had no actual experience that permitted me to
		confirm; namely, that <em>society</em> in its true sense consists not in
		the number of those <em>persons</em> with whom one converses, but in the
		number
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
			   of ideas excited in one's own mind. Glenalta completely
		illustrates this observation. A family of five individuals, with
		the addition of two intimate friends, have furnished such variety
		and excitement in the flow of my thoughts, that I appear to have
		lived in a crowd; and through a long duration of time I was
		thinking of this circumstance before I got up this morning as a
		contradiction to the common notion, that when we are most happy
		time seems the fleetest; but I see how it is&mdash;both remarks are
		strictly true.
	</p>

	<p>
		Stimulus of an agreeable diversified nature certainly prevents our
		taking note of time while <em>present</em>, and therefore it may be said
		to glide away rapidly; but when <em>remembered</em>, every circumstance
		which produced a change of pleasure, serves to distinguish one
		portion from another, and thus to afford a sense of progress,
		which the dullness of monotony is incapable of producing, just as
		a single acre of ground, animated by trees, houses, and living
		creatures, fills a much greater extent in imagination, when we
		<em>recollect</em> the landscape, than is occupied
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
														 by a wide expanse of
		ocean, though the latter, when <em>looked</em> upon, appeared a boundless
		prospect; <em>still</em>, however, in the midst of this sunshine of the
		heart, I always bear in mind that its <em>locality</em> is the secret of
		its charm. <em>You</em> would not agree with me, but I am assured that the
		sort of thing that delights where one feels no <em>responsibility</em>,
		would cease to fascinate in the moment that the surrounding world
		came to call one to account for one's country cousins: and these
		dear souls, perhaps, might make one blush at the <em>west end</em>. I
		ought not to say so from any thing that I have seen here; but
		the whole course of our thoughts and feelings is <em>so</em> subject to
		join the tide of opinion, that I hardly dare to assert how far my
		present impressions, vivid as they are, would stand the test of a
		Bond-street jury.
	</p>

	<p>
		As Mrs. Malaprop says, however, "let us not have any retrospections
		as to the future" <i xml:lang="fr">Viva, viva</i>. I am so much better, that I hardly
		remember how I came here in the high road to Charon's ferry.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am longing to hear from you. Don't forget
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
													to let me know about
		Stanhope, as Mr. Otway will be anxious to learn whether you and he
		<em>cement</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Adieu, dear Falkland. Am I not the very pine-apple, and quintessence
		of letter-writers? Huzza!

	<h3>
		LETTER VIII.<br />
		<span class="smcap">Miss Douglas to Miss Sandford.</span>
	</h3>



	<p class="salut">
		My dearest Julia,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		Glenalta.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unfortunately for me, I promised to write again without entering
		into any covenant with you; and were I prevented from performing
		my vow for half a year to come, I suppose that you would be a
		little female Shylock and insist upon your bond, before you put
		pen to paper. I do not know whether I shall do more wisely in
		refraining from all apology for my silence, or in attempting to
		account for it. If you have been able to settle into a regular
		track of daily employment since your return to Checkley, you will
		be able to comprehend how the day should often find us defaulters
		at its close, in at least half the amount of what we had to do
		at its commencement; but if the <em>whirl</em> of travelling be still
		in operation, you may wonder how people,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
												 who are stationary,
		should not have too much time, rather than too little, on hand. I
		will therefore keep on the safe side, and make no excuse, lest it
		should not be considered a valid one, till I know how far you can
		understand our habits of life; but as I am very certain of your
		heart, I will proceed to tell you, as I promised in my last letter,
		of the surprise which Frederick and I have prepared lately for our
		dearest mother.
	</p>

	<p>
		On Wednesday next Arthur is to take a long ride with Mr. George
		Bentley, and Frederick, and I mean to take advantage of our
		cousin's absence to introduce mamma to the <em>retreat</em>, for so we
		have named the spot which is consecrated by our rural labours to
		this idol of our daily worship. Surely such worship cannot be
		idolatry, for through the finest mortal, as the most beautiful
		natural, object, we may pay homage to the God that created it. But
		<em>do</em> we really offer this tribute, or does not too much love&mdash;does
		not too large a share of adoration rest in the channel without
		reaching the source, like the worship of our poor Roman Catholic,
		which
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
			  is certainly given to the pictures and images, that adorn
		their altars rather than to the Divinity which they represent?
		This is a question which my conscience so often asks itself, that
		I believe the true answer would come against me; and yet with
		the half convicted sense of being a sinner, the sin of loving my
		mother beyond due bounds, borrows so much of her character from its
		object, that it <em>appears</em> like virtue, and so deludes.
	</p>

	<p>
		Fred. and I talked the matter over yesterday evening, as we stole
		away to our hallowed bower.
	</p>

	<p>
		When you were at Glenalta, I never told you of the discovery which
		my brother and I had made, because to have mentioned, without
		shewing you, a gem so worthy of your admiration, as I shall
		presently describe, would hardly have been kind. Your curiosity
		and feeling would have been awakened, and I should have feared to
		gratify them lest we might have disturbed the solitary genius of
		the place, who was at that time, a daily visitant at its rustic
		shrine. When first we came here, as I told you in my
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
															 last letter,
		Nanny and Mr. Oliphant were alternately our walking companions.
		Mamma was weak both in body and spirits; and though she made
		exertion to be gay when we were with her, it is only long since
		that period that I have been fully sensible how much we owed her
		for efforts that were beyond her strength. As the mind requires to
		unbend after intense meditation, so her spirit asked repose after
		over excitement, and she used to glide along the shrubbery, meet
		her donkey at its wicket gate, and, following the winding pathway
		of our glen, ascend, as we imagined the mountain that lies beyond
		St. Colman's rock, to breathe the "unchartered air of heaven," in
		full security of not being interrupted; but, as she never went
		accompanied by any one, we still only conjectured whither she
		directed her daily ride: and her sorrow was too sensitive, even to
		our young eyes, to permit of our asking many questions. We had been
		at Glenalta for three years, before Frederick and I, who were then
		allowed to visit our poor people at a distance, and explore our
		glens alone, found ourselves one day
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
											 about three miles from home,
		and along the course of the same rivulet which sports so gracefully
		near our moss-house, at the most enchanting spot that I ever
		beheld. It is a tiny dell, shut out, or rather shut in, from all
		the world besides. A Liliputian lawn of the softest green, and not
		more than a few yards in circumference, serves as a pedestal to one
		single tree, the only one of its kind in the whole scene. This tree
		is a beach of surpassing beauty, which casts its delicate branches
		in a sweeping curve round the little area which it occupies,
		forming an umbrella of shade, except in one part, where a natural
		opening invites underneath its lovely archway.
	</p>

	<p>
		The stream, which near Glenalta is comparatively tame, though
		sweetly fanciful, assumes a bolder aspect at the retreat, and
		dashes over fragments of broken rock, which are richly clothed with
		fern and ivy, and start from masses of holly, and other brushwood,
		that grow luxuriantly down at each side, to the verge of our
		mountain brook, which makes a circuit round the beech, so as to
		render the <em>velvet cushion</em> on
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
											which it stands almost a little
		island. As the bleak heath-covered hill rises in every direction,
		you could fancy yourself to have reached a fertile oasis in the
		midst of a desert. Nothing of animated life appeared in view
		except two young goats that had ventured down the precipice, and
		the silence was only broken by the rush of waters. Frederick and I
		stood quite transfixed; but when our first exclamations of wonder
		and delight had subsided, we determined on exploring farther, and
		passing round the tree we scrambled to the other side, and found a
		rude seat of stone, over which a tuft of alders and mountain-ash
		had formed a roof impenetrable to the sun. A variety of the
		beautiful orchis, cowslip, and primrose tribes intermixed with wild
		violets of the most brillant purple, enameled the ground, and the
		softest moss lined every part of this sylvan niche with refreshing
		verdure. We sat down in a perfect ecstacy, then pulled bundles of
		flowers, drank at the stream, and were indulging in all the luxury
		of our good fortune, when something white struck my eye, clung
		into the root of an old
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
								hazle which stood a little below us. I
		pointed it out to Frederick, who immediately jumped down the rock,
		and found a bit of paper rolled round a pencil. It was torn, and
		had been injured by wet, having evidently lain for a long time in
		its concealment. The holly which grows so abundantly all over the
		rocks, had furnished its evergreen protection so as to save the
		paper from melting away, and the weight of the pencil, round which
		it was tightly wrapped, had contributed with the tangled roots, to
		prevent its being carried away by the wind. We eagerly unfolded
		our mysterious prize, and with some difficulty decyphered, at last
		completely, and in mamma's hand-writing, the following lines:
	</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="i0">Inscribed upon thy polished rind,</span>
			<span class="i2">That name was once engraved,</span>
			<span class="i0">Which, traced upon my heart I find,</span>
			<span class="i2">The wreck that grief has saved.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="i0">Nor ruthless time, nor cankering care,</span>
			<span class="i2">Hath swept that sacred line;</span>
			<span class="i0">The perfect record lingers there,</span>
			<span class="i2">Carved on the faithful shrine.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
			<span class="i0">Yes, and within thy beechen breast,</span>
			<span class="i2">Sweet sympathy conceals</span>
			<span class="i0">The characters that once confessed,</span>
			<span class="i2">Thy bark no more reveals.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="i0">Thy glossy fane now furrowed o'er,</span>
			<span class="i2">Protects from wandering gaze</span>
			<span class="i0">That name adored, which never more</span>
			<span class="i2">Thy jealous love betrays.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="i0">Thy roughened form,&mdash;my time-worn cheek,</span>
			<span class="i2">Alike refuse to tell</span>
			<span class="i0">The signs that idlers vainly seek</span>
			<span class="i2">Within this leafy dell.</span>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="i0">But when the axe hath laid thee low,</span>
			<span class="i2">And bowed thy graceful head;</span>
			<span class="i0">And <em>me</em>, life's latest mortal foe,</span>
			<span class="i2">Shall number with the dead;</span>
		</div>

		<div class="stanza">
			<span class="i0">Then in our bosoms' inmost seat,</span>
			<span class="i2">The self same image found,</span>
			<span class="i0">Reveals to view its deep retreat,</span>
			<span class="i2">Fast in the heart-strings bound.</span>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>
		We gazed on each other, and the truth flashed upon our hearts in
		the same instant. Frederick and I, by a movement imparted from
		within, darted towards the tree together, and on examination
		found a part of the once varnished surface, raised into irregular
		carbuncles, where the bark had closed with time over some letters
		no longer legible. With much pains, we satisfied ourselves that the
		initials H. A. C. D. had
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
								 been interwoven, and cut in the bark from
		the external face of which, these letters had been carried inward
		by the process of annual growth. It immediately occurred to us,
		that our beloved parents had made this a favourite haunt in happier
		days; and that the undying memory of some faithful mourner had
		sought again these now almost obliterated characters. Such mourner
		could have been no other than the dear surviving guardian of our
		youth; and our tears flowed without restraint, as we read again and
		again, the stanzas of which we had become accidentally possessed.
		The first movement of our minds was, as you may suppose, to restore
		them directly to their author; and it was not without considerable
		reasoning between ourselves, that either could convince the other
		of its being better to suppress the verses, and say nothing of the
		<em>retreat</em>. From mamma's never having communicated any hint relative
		to this little hermit-cell, it was obvious that she did not wish
		us to discover its situation; then, the pencilled lines had been
		lost for some time. She had made no inquiry about them; her memory
		was able in
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
					all probability, to supply them again; and in giving
		up what manifestly appeared to be mamma's own composition, such
		explanation might have ensued as would have opened all her wounds
		afresh, and destroyed ever afterwards the pleasure which she
		appeared to feel in visiting the sequestered spot which we had
		discovered. Upon mature deliberation then we agreed to hush up our
		little adventure, and keep the tender effusion that we had found,
		till some natural opportunity might occur of giving it back again
		to its owner.
	</p>

	<p>
		Time has rolled on, and the gradual influence of its healing power
		is happily illustrated in the improved condition of our precious
		<em>charge</em>, (for I consider her as a blessing conferred upon her
		children, henceforward placed peculiarly in their care); and a
		moment having arrived in which Frederick agreed with me that we
		might venture to commence our little scheme, we set to work in
		the beginning of November, just at the time when the change of
		weather, and the death of faithful Dapple, that sole companion of
		our <em>pilgrim's progress</em>, conspired to prevent the discovery
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
		of our plan. Poor Tom Collins and his son, who live not far from the
		scene of our operations, were necessarily let into the secret, for
		they were manual contributors to the execution of our project; and
		had this <em>not</em> been the case, I should have still rewarded the
		former by a confidence, the <em>distinguishing</em> nature of which he
		knows how to appreciate, in return for a trait of feeling so unlike
		one's abstract notion of a <em>peasant</em>, and so delicate, that I must
		tell the anecdote of him, before I proceed with our works at the
		retreat. One day preparatory to our design, Frederick and I watched
		an opportunity when mamma was obliged to drive on business to a
		little town in our neighbourhood, and paid a visit to our favourite
		spot. We were sitting talking over past, present, and future,
		when a slight rustling amongst the leaves, announced the approach
		of some one; and presently poor Tom Collins, on tip-toe, and his
		finger, in sign of caution, placed upon his lip, stood before us.
		"Och, then," said he, "its I that am after running to stop your
		honours from coming down at all, at all, into my misthess's
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
		nook. I does be keeping the childer always from this place till the sun
		does be setting, and then I knows there 'ont be any danger in life
		of seeing her honour, for becaase she only comes of a morning."
	</p>

	<p>
		"And Tom," answered I, "why are you so uneasy from the fear of
		seeing mamma?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"Och, then, miss, my heart, I'll tell ye, and I never tould it
		afore, nor wouldn't now, only becaase I never seed any one of
		quality like, here, only her honour's self; and now if I don't
		tell, why may be she'd be fretted to think that you and Masther
		Fred. would find her out in her nook; and I knows very well, that
		she wouldn't like it, for when it plased God to take my poor boy
		Darby away from me, I'd covet to be all day moping if I could, down
		in that very bottom. Why, then, sure enough, it was there I was one
		Midsummer day, lying down flat on the ground beyont the big holly
		stump, and thinking heavy enough of Darby, becaase of all days in
		the year, 'twas his own birth day, when I heard a whispering like,
		under the baach-tree, so I gets up fair and softly, without making as
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
		much stir as a baatle among the laaves; why then <em>mavourneen</em>,
		what would I see but my misthess on her two knees, upon the could
		ground, looking up and praying like. Well, there I stood, and I
		seed her crying like droppings from the ivy beyant; and I heerd the
		words axing the Lord to make yees good childer, and mark yees to
		Glory. And then she'd ax Him to make her a good mother, and to keep
		and to help her all the days of her life; and sure, be the same
		token, God listened to her prayer, for she's the best of ladies.
		After that she'd get up, and talk to the tree all as one as if it
		was a Christian, about my maasther, for I heerd her say, <em>Hinnery</em>,
		and so I knew well enough who she'd be spaiking of, being that I'd
		be often that way talking myself to the air, as I may say, about
		Darby. Well, my heart grew so big, that I thought it would fairly
		jump out o'me; so with that, I slinged away; and seeing poor Dapple
		another day fastened behind the rock above, I says to myself, to be
		sure says I, she's moping there like myself, and so I never would
		come again till night fall; but when I have time, I
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
															does be above,
		not far off, only she can't see me, be raison I'd like, if any
		thing would be for going down the clift, to stop 'em till she'd be
		clear and clane out o' the place for the day. So that's all about
		it; and she don't be coming so often now, tho' in the main-time
		'tis constant at her prayers or writing on a bit of a paper, or
		reading out of a little book that she does be, whenever she'll come
		to the lag below."
	</p>

	<p>
		The eloquence of Demosthenes could not have worked upon our hearts
		like this simple story. I seized instinctively upon the rough hand
		of honest Tom, and Frederick did so likewise. We were too full to
		utter a word, but we each of us resolved that this trait should
		have its recording angel, and that, however tears might bedew
		the remembrance of it, they should never blot out the registry.
		Of this we <em>said</em> nothing, for it would have been a species of
		sacrilege to sully the purity of such genuine feeling, by making
		it an apparent cause of any temporal benefit. Oh what a withering
		breath is praise, and how sickly do the motives of action become,
		when flattery, that <em>simoon</em> of the heart,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
														has passed over them!
		We now communicated our embryo purpose to Tom, and told him that
		we intended proceeding to work on the following day, as it was not
		likely, that during the winter season, my mother would visit her
		seat again. Pride and joy took possession of his countenance, as we
		developed our plan; and had we presented him with a purse of gold,
		I do not think that the expression of his face could have indicated
		such happiness as the feeling of being thus distinguished by our
		confidence, inspired.
	</p>

	<p>
		I must now describe what we have done: Mr. Oliphant has been let
		into our councils, and his excellent taste has assisted us not
		a little; but dear Phil., Charlotte, Fanny, and Arthur are as
		ignorant as mamma, of our necromancy. A beautiful rustic temple
		has taken place of the stone seat. It is lined with reeds,
		interleaved in a sort of basket-matting, which fits close to
		the inside; and the front is supported by pillars of twisted
		elm, which are surmounted by capitals of remarkably fine cones
		from the stone-pine. These supporters are covered with clematis,
		honeysuckle, and roses. A circular seat, equal
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
													   in softness to any
		Ottoman divan, is raised to a convenient height, and covered with
		the same reed-matting which I have mentioned. The paving is of
		snow-white pebbles, which Collins' little girls have collected for
		me on the strand, and the whole Glen has been decorated by every
		thing either fragrant or beautiful, which was not out of character
		with its wildness. I have trained a number of Alpine plants over
		the rocks, and taught the lovely water-lily to unfold its flowers
		upon a tiny basin, which Frederick has scooped out, lower down the
		stream. We have secured this bower from trespassers, and made a
		serpentine path through the tangled brush-wood, to permit the dear
		sovereign of these sylvan dominions to descend the hill without
		fatigue, and admit of her being brought by Dapple the <em>second</em>, up
		to the door of her rural palace. When this was completed, we set
		to work at Tom Collins' abode, which is now raised and enlarged
		into a thoroughly comfortable habitation. A nice cabbage-garden
		is inclosed at the back, and the front is thickly planted with
		a double hedge of quicks and privet, separating a
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
														  little space
		from the moor, which is filled with sweet, but common flowers. The
		family have been set to spin, and are already clothed in their own
		manufacture. Frederick has given poor Tom a cow, to which I have
		added half a dozen sheep; and such a scene of contentment above,
		and of beauty below, it would be difficult to equal: at least so
		<em>we</em> think; and when we contemplate the entire as a creation of
		our own, Frederick and I certainly do confess to some degree of
		self-complacency. But as far as I have hitherto narrated, only
		relates to the <em>body</em> of our exertions. I must now describe the
		<em>soul</em> of them. In the back part of our rustic temple, is a door
		so completely concealed by the matting of reeds, as not to be
		discernible to ordinary observers. This door, upon being opened,
		discovers a little cell of just sufficient size to admit of one
		person's sitting in it without inconvenience. Its furniture
		consists of a small pedestal of delicate workmanship in white
		marble, upon which Frederick has placed the exquisite urn that
		you may remember, of alabaster, found at Pompeïa. It belonged to
		my father, and has
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
						   been kept in a closet, hidden from every eye
		since the time of his death. Upon the front of the pedestal which
		supports it, we have had engraved the following lines:&mdash;
	</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<span class="i0">Bless'd refuge of a sad and broken heart,</span>
		<span class="i0">Soft soothing solitude, thy balm impart;</span>
		<span class="i0">Come with thy gentle train, thy peaceful rest,</span>
		<span class="i0">Thy tender stillness to this grief-worn breast.</span>
		<span class="i0">With thee, how sweet to climb the craggy way,</span>
		<span class="i0">And o'er these rocky cliffs in silence stray,</span>
		<span class="i0">In Nature's temple to expand the soul,</span>
		<span class="i0">While tears distil refreshing as they roll,</span>
		<span class="i0">What fond deceit the present to beguile,</span>
		<span class="i0">And bid the shades of past delight to smile.</span>
		<span class="i0">Call back the dreams of youth, and hope, and love,</span>
		<span class="i0">And 'mid the dear aërial phantoms rove.</span>
		<span class="i0">But hush! too sharp that pang, my heart gives o'er,</span>
		<span class="i0">Invoke the memory of thy bliss no more!</span>
		<span class="i0">Raise up to heaven thy soul, quit earth, and fly,</span>
		<span class="i0">Go seek thy refuge in yon azure sky;</span>
		<span class="i0">Ask mercy's aid to shed celestial light</span>
		<span class="i0">Upon the dismal gloom of sorrow's night,</span>
		<span class="i0">And God's own spirits of the mountain air,</span>
		<span class="i0">Shall waft on high the deep unuttered prayer,</span>
		<span class="i0">While filial love shall consecrate the scene,</span>
		<span class="i0">That gave a mother's tears for hope serene.</span>
	</div>

	<p>
		Immediately behind the urn, which with its pedestal is let into a
		niche, is a pretty little arched window of stained glass; and at
		the opposite extremity of our Anchorite's cell stands a
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
																slab of
		Kerry marble, which rests upon a simple cabinet of the beautiful
		black oak of the bog which our island furnishes from its <em>ebony</em>
		stores. When opened, a flat box of polished beech-wood presents
		itself, and this serves as a solid portfolio, preserving from damp
		an exquisite drawing in pencil, by Frederick, of the large tree
		to which you have been already introduced. Underneath the tree,
		mamma's lines which we found, are neatly transcribed; and the old
		pencil, with its original paper wrapped round it, as when first
		discovered in its hiding place, and a pocket Bible, in the first
		page of which, after the name of Caroline Douglas, are written
		these words; "The prayer of the righteous availeth much," complete
		the furniture of this rustic sanctuary.
	</p>

	<p>
		When Frederick and I went this morning at early dawn, to see that
		all was finished according to our design, we found Tom Collins
		already there, leaning against one of the pillars, in an attitude
		of contemplation. He started from his reverie as we approached, and
		twirling his old hat in his hands, resting first upon one foot, then
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
		upon the other, he said, after the usual salutation, "Miss,
		dear, I was thinking that you would'nt refuse me, if you plase,
		just to let me be standing overright there beyant the big baach,
		when my mistress will be coming&mdash;I'll engage I'll not let her see a
		bit o'me, any more than if I was a sperret, nor I'ont brathe a word
		good, or bad, only to set my two looking eyes upon her, when she'll
		see the place you done for her." Could such a request fail of being
		granted?
	</p>

	<p>
		This romantic mountaineer is full of the finest sensibilities,
		and not perverted, as so much of acute feeling often is, to the
		purposes of discontent and ingratitude. Tom is a good husband,
		a good son, and a good father. Yet he knows not a letter in the
		alphabet.
	</p>

	<p>
		"What shameful ignorance," I hear you exclaim! Ignorance of
		letters it surely is, but not shameful. You, in England, can be
		sure of giving your poor a religious education. We cannot! but
		some of our peasants <em>act</em> the Bible, which their priests will not
		allow them to read; and what benefit would these derive from the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
		pennyworth of sedition or impurity which they might be permitted to
		purchase, and instructed to peruse? With what fresh delight have I
		sometimes returned to this dear desert, after having visited some
		of the districts <em>said</em> to be civilized when compared with our
		neighbourhood!&mdash;Oh it is a great mistake to imagine that <em>reading</em>
		is a cure for every evil, unless the Bible be allowed to offer its
		blessed promises, and hold forth its bright meed of reward for
		patience in adversity, and resignation under privations, which all
		other learning is calculated to reveal in the strongest light,
		without affording any means to remedy. The will of God has made
		inequality the very essence of every social scheme. No spread of
		knowledge can improve the lot of him who must till the ground in
		the sweat of his brow, if that knowledge be not of a nature to
		make him <em>better</em>, and therefore happier; and I never pass by our
		smith's forge, which is the parish coffee-house, without hearing
		expressions, and seeing looks that mark a murmuring spirit.
	</p>

	<p>
		The other day I asked an aged peasant, who lives on the lands of
		Lisfarne, about fairies;
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
								 "Did you ever see the <em>Luracawn</em>," said
		I, "of which people say, that it is a sort of fairy that lives
		always by the sea-side, and carries a purse such as we often find
		on the strand with strings to it?"
	</p>

	<p>
		"No, miss, I never did <em>myself</em>; but in ould times they used to be
		seen plenty enough."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Then," answered I, "perhaps the truth may be, that the people now
		are grown too wise to believe the stories which were swallowed in
		old times."
	</p>

	<p>
		The old man replied, "Miss, there's a great dael o' larning that
		is'nt knowledge, and there's more of it than is good, I can assure
		you. The people now gets hould o'books, and cares very little about
		their parents, who were better folk than many o'<em>them</em> that are
		going now a' days."
	</p>

	<p>
		"Then you don't approve of learning Andrew."&mdash;"Why, miss, you might
		as well say I don't approve o'my fellow craitures. There's two
		kinds o'one as of the other.&mdash;Good men and good books, bad men and
		bad books. I likes the two first, and I don't like the two last, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
		when people gets hould o'larning, the're vastly fonder o'the
		bad than the good."
	</p>

	<p>
		Really these people astonish me by the clearness of their views
		and the acuteness of their observations. But before I close
		this long letter, I must say a word of Arthur Howard, who is a
		great favourite already at Glenalta. Had he been born under a
		happier star than that which presided at his birth, he would be a
		charming young man, and great improvements may yet be effected,
		for he is young and full of generous feeling as of quick tact.
		The contrarieties which nature and art sometimes display in
		their contest for pre-eminence in his actions, would divert us
		excessively, if there were not so much to love and regard in the
		compound, that vexation must ever be a predominating sentiment
		when he obeys an unworthy impulse. Selfishness is, I believe, the
		leading vice of fashionable people; and it must be very difficult
		to throw off the habits in which education has taught us that
		comfort (that <em>aldermanic</em> little word, as many use it) consists.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
		The first thought in what is called the world, appears to be,
		"is such or such a thing for <em>my</em> pleasure, <em>my</em> interest, <em>my</em>
		convenience;" and the <em>last</em> is, "whether the matter in question
		be useful, or agreeable to other people?" I am now speaking of the
		school, not the scholar, for though Arthur has necessarily adopted
		<em>some</em> of the folly in the midst of which he has lived, moved, and
		had his being, it is astonishing how little the natural tendencies
		of his heart are obscured. He came here, as I told you, with very
		strong prejudices, but I perceive with delight that they are fading
		away; and, I believe, that he thinks less hardly than he did when
		he first came amongst us, of female improvement. How could he bask
		in the sunshine of mamma's sweet smile, and enjoy the constant
		variety of her unrivalled powers in conversation, without feeling
		how compatible are the charms of high cultivation with all that
		is excellent in private life&mdash;all that is fascinating in female
		softness?
	</p>

	<p>
		As I listened eagerly to a dialogue the other day, in which she
		was engaged, shedding light and animation upon every subject which
		came
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
			 before her, I could not help thinking, that were amusement
		the only object and end of existence, cultivation of mind would
		appear, in my opinion, to be an indispensable requisite in the art
		of attaining it. The gay world, I suppose has its charms, and may
		attract for a season. Change of place, and change of faces, may
		please perhaps for a time, but this cannot last for ever, and when
		the period arrives in which people <em>must</em> rely upon the resources
		of <em>home</em>, what an immeasurable distance must there be between the
		full mind and the empty one! The very playfulness of a superior
		person is so exhilarating that I never grow weary of it; but of all
		the tiresome companionships on earth, it is that of animal spirits
		in perennial flow, that bear no treasure on the tide. How well Pope
		has expressed what I mean! "For lively Dulness ever loves a joke."
	</p>

	<p>
		I must reserve space for a concluding word after our visit at the
		Retreat. Till then adieu.
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, dear Julia, I feel the repose of my own room most welcome
		after the excitement of this day. The sun shone in full splendor
		on our project. Last night Frederick and I spoke to
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
															mamma of some
		trifling alterations that we had been making for the comfort of Tom
		Collins and his family, whose little dwelling had suffered much
		from the winter storms.
	</p>

	<p>
		"Yes, my loves," said she, "I am rejoiced that your activity has
		anticipated me. Since the death of my poor Dapple, I have not
		gone so far as Tom's house, and have been <em>intending</em> a visit to
		the mountain, till you have made me ashamed by this lesson on
		procrastination. The truth is, that my present <em>steed</em> is so unlike
		his predecessor in gait and humour, that he and I are not such
		friends as to make me quite at home in his company; and I hate
		to have Paddy running after me. My morning rambles were always
		solitary, and I should not be at ease now in going alone, till I
		am more accustomed to my <em>new Neddy</em>, or his temper becomes more
		amiable; but all this is no excuse for not having employed other
		eyes to see that the Collins' were not unroofed. I wonder why Tom
		did not come."
	</p>

	<p>
		"We happened to see him," said Frederick, "which probably prevented
		his applying to you, as Emily and I did the needful; but if
		to-morrow
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
				   should be a fine day, suppose that I drive you and Em.
		in the pony car, before breakfast, and we will shew you how we have
		patched up these poor people for the present."
	</p>

	<p>
		Mamma consented, and this morning early we sat out; but my tears
		suffocate me at the bare remembrance of my mother's emotion.
		She was amazed and delighted with our improvements. The garden,
		the hedge, the clean house, and clean people, all appeared the
		effect of enchantment. Tom, his wife, and children, grinned with
		broad uncontrolled rapture, and overwhelmed the little party with
		blessings. When we had praised, and been praised (<em>such</em> praise
		warms the heart without enervating its powers), Frederick took
		mamma's arm, and said, "You must come, dearest mother, to look at
		a dell which Emily and I discovered some time ago, the sweetest
		spot that you ever beheld." A faint blush overspread her cheek, and
		I perceived a thrill run through her frame. She hesitated, then
		hinted that the banks were steep, and that we should be late for
		breakfast; but <em>we</em> coaxed, and she evidently not desiring to say
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
		how well she was acquainted with the scene which she was about to
		visit, suffered herself to be led forward, I walking behind with a
		palpitating heart, down the narrow descent, and poor Tom following
		at a discreet distance. As we proceeded, I observed mamma gaze to
		the right and the left with amazement; but when our rustic temple
		burst upon her eye, the expression of her countenance became
		painfully inquisitive. The mysterious door was opened, Frederick
		pushed her gently in, closed the wicker-work, and waited with me in
		the outer inclosure. We heard her sob aloud, and in a few moments
		she was in our arms.
	</p>

	<p>
		Here I pause. The sweetness of the feeling reciprocally called
		forth, would baffle my little powers of language to describe. Is it
		not Cora, in the play of Pizarro, who talks of three bright moments
		in her life? No moment in any one's life ever surpassed this
		expansion of hearts linked by a tie so pure end so affectionate as
		binds our's to each other. We sat till breakfast was forgotten.
		We looked, and looked again, and when the first swell of painful
		pleasure had given
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
						   way to more tranquil sensations, <em>we</em>
		architects became garrulous, and in the vanity of success, hurrying
		our beloved mother from flower to flower, shrub to shrub, rock
		to rivulet, that we might not lose one <em>atom</em>, or one <em>item</em> of
		applause; and at length so completely communicated the contagion of
		<em>gladness</em> to her who had inspired the emotion in ourselves, that
		she entered zealously into the idea of surprising the rest of our
		party, adding, "I will first come here alone with our dear friend
		of Lisfarne, after which we will revisit this beloved retreat in a
		body, and enjoy in common the pleasures which you have created." We
		were now turning our steps towards Glenalta, when the sight of poor
		Tom wiping his eyes in the sleeve of his coat, as he leaned against
		the beech-tree, arrested mamma's attention. She went up, shook him
		warmly by the hand, and without a word uttered on either side, we
		separated.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am promised a conveyance of this <em>pamphlet</em> rather than letter
		by that excellent creature George Bentley, and I am particularly
		pleased with the power of sending you so voluminous a
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
															  packet
		by private hand at present, because I may not be able to write
		for some time again. We are all going to Killarney. Arthur is an
		enthusiast about our Glen scenery, and I enjoy exceedingly the
		delight of shewing him that gem of purest water. Some anxiety,
		however, is always wisely mingled in our cup, which mamma's promise
		to accompany us, would have rendered too intoxicating, and this
		anxiety is relating to dearest Fred. whose College examinations
		must precede our excursion. He and Mr. Oliphant leave us on
		Thursday next, and will only be absent during five or six days. I
		cannot sleep from feverish solicitude, though I believe that my
		Fred. is very well prepared; but we have so managed this charming
		trip to Killarney, that it will either crown our victory, should
		such happiness be in store, or divert our melancholy, should the
		dear fellow be doomed to suffer a disappointment. Phil. and Mr.
		Bentley are to be of our party. Do you know that Arthur is quite
		a surprising botanist already; and as I am his <em>Linnæa</em>, I am as
		proud as a peacock of my pupil. He can now walk without <i>leading
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
		strings</i>, and is grown so expert that our rambles are become trials
		of rival skill. Well, I must bid my dear friends adieu. With many
		loves from Charlotte and Fanny to Bertha and Agnes; and <em>all</em>
		our loves to your <em>dearly</em> loved aunt, believe me, Julia's most
		affectionate,

	<h3>
		LETTER IX. <br />
		<span class="smcap">Charles Falkland to Arthur Howard.</span>
	</h3>



	<p class="salut">
		My dear Howard,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		Rome.
	</p>

	<p>
		You are, indeed, a <em>prince</em> of letter writers, and the delight
		which you have afforded me is inexpressible. Two of your admirable
		journals reached me at Pisa, and the last treasure I have
		received since I came here in company with&mdash;whom do you think?
		Why, actually, Mr. Richard Oliphant, young Stanhope, and I are
		dwelling under the same roof, and enthusiastically employed in
		exploring the wonders both within and without this enchanting city.
		Stanhope has given Mr. Otway a detailed account of our meeting,
		in consequence of a letter from Lisfarne, after your arrival at
		Glenalta; and I will
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
							 therefore not take up your time, nor my own,
		in repetition, but proceed to say how greatly pleased I am with my
		new acquaintances. Their grand object was Rome, and I determined
		to quit Pisa much sooner than was my original design, that I might
		enjoy such excellent society. Here then we are together, and,
		should no unforeseen circumstances prevent the completion of our
		arrangements, I think it likely that we shall not separate hastily,
		but visit Florence, and Naples, see Pæstum, go to Venice, and pass
		the winter at Paris in company with each other. If <em>you</em> join us
		there what a coterie shall we form. I feel now as if I were in
		the midst of the Douglas group. I can see the very countenances,
		and already make my selections, <em>even</em> in that society where all
		are so much to my taste, that it seems at first view difficult to
		<em>prefer</em>, without doing injustice. From Stanhope I receive the
		most satisfactory answers to every question which your <em>volume</em>
		suggests; and, oh! what happiness it is to know that in any
		favoured spot of earth such purity and peace
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
													 are to be found as
		bless that little valley of Glenalta with their presence. In any
		situation the contemplation of such a family would possess charms
		for me beyond the power of any other pleasure to excite; but if it
		required to be heightened through contrast, surely that contrast
		is to be met with on the Continent! Yes, to a sober mind, there is
		something horrible in the metamorphosis produced in the minds of
		some with whom you and I are acquainted. Letters are so frequently
		opened at the foreign post-offices, and so often lost, that I shall
		be prudent, and not send names out to the winds; however, you will
		have no difficulty in recognizing F&mdash;&mdash; and L&mdash;&mdash; by their initials;
		and, though you are <em>still</em> a wild sort of being yourself, you
		will be sorry to hear that they are immersed in every thing at
		Paris which they used to withstand so vigorously at Cambridge. We
		ranked them there amongst the <i xml:lang="fr">élite</i>, for genius, good taste, and
		polished habits. Alas! how are the mighty fallen? The facilitie
		afforded in Paris to the commission of every vice, are, perhaps
		hardly greater than those
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
								  which London offers to tempt unwary
		youth; but there is all the difference in the world between the
		<em>manner</em> of doing the thing in the two capitals. Notwithstanding
		the daily intercourse between England and France, there is <em>still</em>
		such a body of national virtue and good feeling unshaken in the
		former country, that the most profligate can hardly sin with
		absolute impunity, and vice is scarcely bold enough to throw off
		the veil which, however flimsy, still protects some purer eyes from
		beholding corruption in all its deformity. Have you ever felt, when
		you lingered at a ball till day-light, and the bright beams of a
		newly risen sun shone with open freshness on the expiring lamps,
		the pale faces, and the tinsel finery of the last night's pageant;
		a sort of undefined sensation of shame at being thus caught by
		the truth-telling hour of waking seriousness, in the midst of a
		scene so unsuited to the time? If you have, I may avail myself of
		the similitude to describe the difference which I feel between
		England and the Continent. I say Continent at large, for the great
		towns are alike in this; ours is a daylight dance,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
														   while here
		is the nightly revel. With us the clear sunshine of opinion, if
		it cannot prevent excess, at least exhibits its faded form and
		haggard countenance, pronouncing on their ugliness, and inducing
		their concealment. Cross the channel, and a new order of things
		presents itself. <i xml:lang="la">Decorum</i> is busy indeed, but it is to deceive,
		and while the fascination of gaiety and ease presents an opiate to
		circumspection, the good taste which borrows an external clothing
		of propriety in which to dress the votaries of pleasure, finishes
		the delusion, and many young men are not aware of the counterfeit
		till they are fast bound in the spell like Telemachus in the island
		of Calypso. The French language too, now so universal, is a potent
		ingredient in the intoxicating cup. It acts as a <em>mask</em>, and since
		I left England, I have met with numbers of my countrymen, aye, and
		countrywomen also, who say things at Paris in the idiom of another
		tongue, which could never find utterance in their own, though no
		infringement of decency in <em>conduct</em> would be tolerated publicly
		in good society abroad. All this renders foreign travelling a very
		insidious
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
				   poison, and happy are those who can enjoy the benefits
		derivable from extensive acquaintance with men and manners, without
		risk of confounding the boundaries which separate vice from virtue.
		In short, no man is <em>safe</em>, upon whom the grand tour produces
		other effect than to send him back with increased thankfulness to
		the British Isles, as (waving adieu to the shores he has quitted)
		he borrows the words of the poet to say, "these are my visits;"
		and, turning to the white cliffs of Albion, finishes the line with
		"but thou art my home." It would be stupid, however, as well as
		ungrateful to deny the witchery, by way of securing either one's
		self, or one's friends against its allurements. This device, which
		my worthy guardian, I believe, in the honesty of his heart employed
		as a bastion of strength to fortify my weakness, will never, in
		any case, survive the first shot that experience levels against
		it. It is in vain to call the Syren's song discord, to say that
		nectar is but extract of wormwood, and Ambrosia but a mess of
		Spartan pottage. The first sound, and the first taste, disabuse
		the ignorant, adding the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
								 stimulus of surprise to what was but too
		attractive without it. No, let us fairly acknowledge the magic, and
		then try our best to repel its influence. You know that I shall
		keep all my <em>scenery</em>, whether moral or physical, for fireside
		talk, <em>perhaps</em> at Glenalta, and not so much as a moon-beam on the
		Coliseum will you have in the way of description, already exhausted
		by abler limners than I am; but I cannot avoid adding my testimony
		to the charms of foreign society. It is not that it is wiser or
		better; it is not that you have better cheer, or one half so good
		accommodation as at home. No, the whole necromancy exits in one
		monosyllable&mdash;ease. In England ease is <em>practised</em>; in France it
		springs naturally from every one with whom you converse. In England
		people are <em>remembering</em> to forget themselves; in France they do
		<em>really</em> forget themselves, and in this simple circumstance resides
		the whole secret of being <em>at ease</em>. In England people <em>run</em> to
		shew you how freely they can <em>walk</em>, never considering that <em>ease</em>,
		that grand desideratum, is as much banished by over exertion to
		be gay, as by the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
						   torpor of <i xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</i>. In France there
		is neither a <em>jerking</em> activity, nor a leaden stupor, but people
		convey the idea, while you are in their company, of being pleased,
		interested, and animated, by the subject of conversation. There is
		no <em>acted</em> egotism, no effort at making display; and the effect of
		an evening passed in a Parisian society is that of gaiety without
		fatigue. You have, perhaps, not heard a single sentence that you
		desire to treasure; but there has been no <em>strain</em> upon your
		animal spirits. You have spoken naturally what really presented
		itself to be said, instead of <em>fishing</em> for a theme, and having to
		recollect at every turn whether you were going to speak to a man
		or a woman. In fine, conversation, however trifling, flows on the
		Continent, while with us it resembles <em>pints</em> of water, <em>chucked</em>
		one after another into a pump. You work the handle, and up comes
		your pint, but there is no more till you make a new deposit, and a
		fresh exertion. It is unnecessary to add that I speak of <em>mixed</em>
		society, and of its <em>average</em> state in the two countries. Come to
		the sincere intercourse of mind and heart, when the
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
															 affectations
		of fashion are in <em>abeyance</em>, or I should more justly say where
		they have never existed, and who would go to any climate of the
		earth from that in which our happy stars have placed us, to enjoy
		"the feast of reason and the flow of soul!" Ireland and Scotland,
		remember, are always included in this preference. But we do not
		understand <em>society</em>, even imitating the French, as we prove,
		alas, that we can do continually, in their <em>faults</em>, while we
		cannot throw off our whalebone and buckram. In France there is
		much less of <em>gossip</em> than in England; the King, the Court, the
		national prosperity, or distress, the political relations of
		Europe, philosophy, sentiment, all find their way broken down to
		a convenient circulable medium into company. You hear many false
		positions in each several department, but you have likewise a great
		deal of good sense and discrimination; and at all events you have
		<em>common property</em> in the subjects which are treated in a French
		circle, as if they really <em>interested</em> the assembly. Perhaps at
		the moment of reading this passage of my letter, you recollect what
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
		<em>pops</em> into my memory in the moment of writing it; I mean
		a paragraph upon which you and I commented together, in one of
		the letters of Madame du Deffand, where she describes to Horace
		Walpole the "<i xml:lang="fr">grand succes</i>" of a <i xml:lang="fr">soirée</i> at her house, from the
		introduction of some paltry New-year or Easter gifts. There is no
		inconsistency here. Whether it be the army, the navy, the funds,
		Cuvier's last work, La Place's talents, the Jardin des Plantes,
		the fashionable actor or musician; the last song, epigram, bon-mot
		cap, bonnet or pin-cushion; the thing is talked of with animation,
		and apparent <em>interest</em>; and it is the want of this that renders
		common place society in England so insufferably dull, as often to
		suggest the idea that the several members who compose it prepare
		for meeting, by committing to memory a set of vapidly disjointed
		questions, and answers; a very catechism of inanity upon the least
		amusing topics which it is possible to select, and invariably such
		as no stranger can participate in from the strict <em>confinement</em>
		of their locality. Here, men, women, old, young, handsome or
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
		ugly; all who can speak the language, take a part according to
		their several measures of ability in the general conversation.
		All look happy, and, from being at perfect ease themselves,
		possess the power of imparting this indispensable charm, this
		<em>essential essence</em> of society, to every one with whom they hold
		companionship. Why cannot we seize upon this talent, and convert it
		to our own use, grateful as we must ever feel for its enlivening
		influence? Our deficiencies in colloquial power have long been
		matter of observation; and it is a trite remark, that the English
		cannot converse; but as it is admitted that every ingredient
		requisite for conversation of the most brilliant kind is to be
		found in our island, it would seem that we only want the method of
		<em>combining</em>, in which our neighbours excel. Your charming circle in
		Ireland have caught the happy art, and vainly should we look around
		for many such specimens as Glenalta exhibits of its perfection; but
		why cannot we all go into company determined to trade freely upon
		our capitals, be they large or small, avoiding on the one hand that
		<em>broad-cast</em>
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
						  sincerity which I am afraid I must call selfishness,
		that refuses to take interest in any concern which does not come
		home to the narrow enclosure of individual loss and gain, pain, or
		pleasure; and on the other, that conventional adoption of trifles
		incapable of amusing in any community, except a paradise of fools,
		with which we are in the habit of performing the <em>mechanism</em> of
		society, fatiguing our friends, and doing penance ourselves?
	</p>

	<p>
		Stanhope is a very fine young man, full of fire and enterprize,
		yet gentle and rational. He has a great deal of taste, and is very
		fond of the classics. We are going presently, armed with a pocket
		Horace, to visit Soracte, accompanied by Oliphant, who is exactly
		the sort of man to whose care Mr. Otway may fearlessly confide
		his charge. He has very good manners, plain, and unassuming, and
		possesses that fortunate mixture of sobriety and cheerfulness,
		which peculiarity befits the character of a tutor, securing at once
		the double tribute of respect and affection.
	</p>

	<p>
		How I long for your next letter, which will
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
													tell me of your
		expedition to Killarney, and, oh that I could transport myself into
		the midst of you!
	</p>

	<p>
		Before I close my letter, I must express the joy of a <em>true</em>
		friend, at finding that you are so happy with your relations. Dear
		Arthur, I <em>knew</em> that your mind would undergo a revolution. It is
		only in <em>progress</em> at present, but I anticipate more decision in
		all your views of people and things. You have too much sense, and
		your feelings are too fine, to admit of your being hood-winked.
		You must not drop into the crowd and suffer yourself to be borne
		upon its tide, without the slightest sympathy in the folly, and,
		shall I add, the <em>vulgarity</em> that surround you. Yes, do not start,
		and suppose that I have lost my senses. I repeat the word; there
		is infinite <em>vulgarity</em> in mere fashion. Something very poor and
		mean, in never daring to think for oneself, and in sacrificing
		every inclination and faculty to the tyranny of arbitrary control;
		but you will speedily rise into the consequence of a rational
		creature. You will take your station amongst intellectual beings, and,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
		giving reins to the <em>real</em> bent of your character, find
		that fulness of mind, which absolutely excludes <i xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>. I cannot
		express how much I am interested by the conversations which you
		have given me. A volume of description would not have conveyed a
		<em>tithe</em> of what you have imparted in the way of information, by
		bringing me thus into the midst of the circle. I see the whole
		mental <em>map</em> before me, and though it would be unreasonable to
		think that you can have time for such details in future, I cannot
		set you entirely free; but would fain hope that, coupled with the
		"incidents" which are all that you <em>promise</em>, henceforward I may
		still find a few of those graphic touches which make me present in
		that unrivalled group with whom your good fortune has <i>bound you
		up</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To Mr. Otway I feel that I may desire to be presented with
		gratitude for the pleasure of which he has thought me worthy, in
		an introduction to my agreeable <em>colleagues</em>; but how shall I
		contrive to make my bow at Glenalta? If you <em>can</em> find a happy
		moment in which to say with a good grace, "<em>Charles Falkland</em>,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
		<em>Mrs. Douglas</em>," you will be more than ever the cherished friend of,
	</p>

	<p class="sigline">
		Your affectionate,<br />
		C. F&mdash;&mdash;.
	</p>

	<p>
		P. S. Whenever you visit the city of the Seven Hills, be sure and
		come hither provided with "Rome in the nineteenth Century." It
		is a tribute which I for one, most willingly pay, to declare this
		work of a female pen to be by a thousand degrees the best <i xml:lang="la">vade
		mecum</i> with which you can furnish yourself.

	<h3>
		LETTER X. <br />
		<span class="smcap">Miss Howard to Arthur Howard, Esq.</span>
	</h3>


	<p class="salut">
		Dear Arthur,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		London.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am so completely <i xml:lang="fr">obsedée</i> with all that I have to accomplish,
		that really you must be very thankful for a letter on any terms at
		present. The fact is that <i xml:lang="fr">la Madre</i> is put into a <em>flutterment</em>
		by news which we have just had from that old quiz, Mr. Ingoldsby,
		of the India House, who says poz, that our ancient uncle is coming
		home as rich as Croesus. What is bringing him, we know not. No
		matter for the cause, the effect is that <em>Ingot</em> (as I always call
		him) came here last week <em>express</em> with the intelligence, since
		when I could not command five minutes, or you should have had the
		<i xml:lang="fr">on dit</i> on the wings of the wind. At first I felt transformed into
		a <em>begum</em>, and transported with joy.
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
												  Shawls, gems, and jewels,
		dazzled my senses. I dreamt of lacs of rupees, snuffed otto in
		every breeze, and read envy, malice, and all uncharitableness, in
		every female face throughout the metropolitan world.
	</p>

	<p>
		Such was the bright vision of half an hour, when, on the <i xml:lang="la">per
		contra</i> side of the question a grisly band rose upon my disordered
		imagination, and I terrified myself with the bare idea, that
		<i xml:lang="fr">vielle-cour</i> is becoming religious, to such a degree that I had
		hardly spirits left for Lady Anne Legrave's "At Home," to which
		I was obliged to go in the evening. I told my fears to mamma and
		Adelaide. The former said that she would hope the best; but, if the
		worst comes to the worst, we must, she says, of course indulge the
		whim as long as it lasts. <em>Ingot</em> does not expect him for several
		months, so that we may take time by the forelock. Then it may be
		only a rumour, and he may be snug at Calcutta; but to make <em>sure</em>,
		we shall take a few <em>good books</em> down to Selby, and, <i xml:lang="la">per</i> favour
		of the Morleys and Arundels, and a few more of the "Praise God
		Barebones" community, we shall
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
									   get up a nice vocabulary, and with
		the help of a fawn-coloured bonnet, which I shall certainly borrow
		from Deborah Prim the grocer, that "demurest of the tabby kind,"
		who is of the society called <em>Friends</em>, I do not despair of acting
		my part <i xml:lang="fr">à merveille</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Mamma is rather <em>cross</em> upon the matter, I think, and <em>foresees</em>
		trouble; but she is always a bit of a Cassandra; and besides, she
		lost horribly the other night at <i xml:lang="fr">ecarté</i>; but for heavens sake
		don't say that I told you so.
	</p>

	<p>
		Adelaide, some how or other too, does not enter into the thing
		<i xml:lang="it">con amore</i>, and is not as much alive as one might expect upon a
		point of such magnitude, for though we have at present nothing to
		go upon but Ingot's testimony, and our own surmises, the return of
		the old lad is a serious sort of concern. If he is in good humour,
		and neither sick, nor pious, we are <i xml:lang="hi">Nabobs</i> and <i xml:lang="hi">Nabobesses</i> at
		once. <i xml:lang="fr">C'est tout dit.</i> If, on the other hand, he has <i>got the
		liver</i> (as the Indians say so vulgarly), or has any crotchet in
		his head, connected with new-light fantasies, I do assure you that
		we may have much vexation
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
								  in prospect; and unless you just put
		yourself in training, and help me out, I do not promise myself any
		effective assistance. Our poor mother is, as I said before, in an
		acid vein, and will require Cheltenham certainly, when we leave
		town; and as to Adelaide, she has other fish to fry, and till the
		cookery is performed or the finny race, sent swimming <i>again from
		the net</i> (<i xml:lang="fr">vous comprenez</i>); I shall not be able to enlist her in
		my pantomime. <i xml:lang="fr">Apropos</i>, Lord George was with us last night, and
		protests that his mother shall give a masquerade at which he will
		perform the part of our old Rajah, and I shall <em>rehearse</em> my new
		character, dressed as a quaker, carrying a basket of <em>tracts</em> on my
		arm, and, followed by half a dozen of his sister, Lady Somerville's
		children, who are perfect cherubs, and are to enact <em>my school</em>.
		You can't fancy any thing more <i xml:lang="fr">spirituel</i>. It was quite a
		<em>scene</em>, and we were decidedly the attraction of the evening. I
		was evidently <i xml:lang="it">prima donna</i>, and felt so <i xml:lang="fr">couleur de rose</i> with
		every thing, and every body, that, forgetful of a quarrel which
		I had with <em>Ady</em>. in the morning, I caught Lord
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
															  Crayton by the
		arm, and, under pretence of asking his advice how to prepare for
		uncle's arrival, gave him such a <em>teeth-watering</em> account of the
		old boy's investments in the 3 <i xml:lang="fr">per cent. Consols</i>, that milord
		stuck, for the rest of the evening, like bird-lime to my pensive
		sister, and almost overturned poor Sir Leonard Twig to <i xml:lang="fr">beau</i> mamma
		down stairs; since when, he has never missed a day in visiting,
		riding with our coterie in the park; and in short I shall not be
		surprized if, before your return from the <em>land of darkness</em>, you
		see a paragraph in the Morning Post: but what should bring the
		Morning Post into the wilderness? I give myself immense credit for
		remembering ever since I performed the Druidical priestess at Lady
		Penguin's, and learned my evening's task for the occasion, that
		Annan is the Druid's name for your island of saints, and that it
		was held to be the dominions of night. It is <i xml:lang="fr">so à propos</i>!
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, but I was talking of Crayton and Adelaide. If indeed a
		London newspaper should meet your eyes while you are suffering
		<em>ostracism</em>,
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
						  (I got <em>such</em> credit for that stroke last night) I
		verily think it not improbable, that you will stumble ere long,
		upon, "It is rumoured in the higher circles, that Viscount Crayton
		is shortly to lead to the Hymeneal altar the lovely Miss A.
		Howard." What more you may see here-after, I cannot give you a hint
		of till you come.
	</p>

	<p>
		Poor Lionel Strangeways bores me to death with his <i xml:lang="fr">petits soins</i>.
		Sir Stephen (that odious name always sets me sneezing) haunts
		Grosvenor-square; and Annesley with whom you used to be so <i xml:lang="fr">lié</i>,
		and who, begging your pardon, is neither more nor less than <i xml:lang="fr">bête</i>,
		worries me to dance wherever I meet him.
	</p>

	<p>
		Adelaide, Crayton, Lord George, and I, made a <i xml:lang="fr">parti quarré</i>, in
		the park yesterday, when we met him quite <i xml:lang="fr">en polisson</i>. He had no
		servant, looked <i xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</i>; and though I am not ill-natured as you
		<em>know</em>, I was obliged to sham blindness, and to pass by without
		even a nod. This may cure <em>him</em>, and release <em>me</em> from a <em>blister</em>.
		If he were not nephew to the Duke of Elsbury, there would be no
		bearing him; but every one knows the relationship, and therefore
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
		one is <em>safe</em> in acknowledging him, though he is so horribly
		disagreeable. Directly after I gave him <em>the go by</em>, I recollected
		that perhaps he had heard from you since your letter to us of the
		5th, and I might have asked how your cough is, but I did not think
		of it in time.
	</p>

	<p>
		The match between Lady J. Marston and Mr. Harrop, ditto between
		Miss Percy and Lord Anfield are off, positively off <i xml:lang="fr">faute
		d'argent</i>. The old Countess held out for £2,000 a-year settlement,
		and Harrop was tied up by his former marriage. It is whispered
		that a Scotch coronet <em>hove in sight</em> just before poor H. got his
		<i xml:lang="fr">congé</i>; but I don't pledge myself for the truth of this <i xml:lang="fr">codicil</i>
		to the story.&mdash;I was interrupted here by Lord George and Mr.
		Cambray, and have been laughing till I am weary at the best thing
		in the world. I told you in a former part of this letter, that I
		was in particularly good spirits last night, and made a sally,
		in speaking of your banishment. Lord George's "<i xml:lang="fr">bravissimo</i>"
		was the signal of applause, but poor Sir Hargrove Miles did not
		know the meaning of <em>ostracism</em>, and
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
												  asked some one (I believe
		young Felton), who, in a funny mood, told him that I was talking
		of oysters. There was a laugh, and some ridiculous things were
		said which I did not hear, but Sir Hargrove looked <em>cloudy</em>, and
		your Marplot friend, Annesley, dreading a meeting in the morning,
		<em>explained</em> like a goose, and put him into good humour by allowing
		him to turn the joke against me. Poor Sir H. has accordingly been
		representing me to-day up and down the whole length of Bond-street
		as a <em>Blue</em>, and were it not that Lord George is my <i xml:lang="fr">chevalier</i>,
		and that <em>nuncle</em> is coming home with a heavy purse, it would not
		be so pleasant. As things <em>are</em>, I can <em>afford</em> a blue banner,
		or, as Lord George says, "We may hoist the <em>blue Peter</em> now if we
		like." He is very witty, and I assure you that <em>our</em> society is
		considered quite <i xml:lang="fr">haut ton</i>&mdash;quite <em>French</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I did not intend to have written six lines, and you see how I have
		run on. Do, my dear, return to us as quickly as possible: you ought
		to be at your <em>post</em> when the old fellow lands on English ground.
		<em>You</em> will of course be his
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
										 principal <em>look out</em>, and ought
		certainly to <em>toad</em> him a little, especially as he will probably
		be very bilious after the voyage. Mamma thinks it likely that the
		new light and the bile will be extinguished together, and proposes
		being ready at an hour's notice to <em>whisk</em> him off to Leamington;
		but should we find that there is any thing so fixed in his
		religious derangement as not to give way immediately to the waters,
		she says that the worst which can happen is our leaving him for a
		time, and going to the continent. He will probably come home after
		so long an absence with his heart in his hand, and be as generous
		as a prince. If so, we shall get plenty of money to take us abroad,
		and thus fare the better for any little <em>twist</em> that he may have
		got from received opinions, I do not say from <em>fashionable</em> ways
		of thinking; for I observe, that East Indians are never people of
		<i xml:lang="fr">ton</i>: they are expensive and luxurious, but want the <i xml:lang="fr">je ne sais
		quoi</i>, that inexplicable <i xml:lang="fr">odeur de la bonne société</i> which marks
		the select few in a London circle.
	</p>

	<p>
		My uncle, in all likelihood, will purchase a
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
													  magnificent seat,
		have a splendid establishment; and as a little time will remove
		any quaint prejudices which he may have contracted, he may keep
		a first-rate table, and see the best company if he is properly
		managed. The <em>great</em> bore will be to watch him so vigilantly as to
		prevent his marrying. I am <em>sure</em> that I know at least six regular
		sieges that will be commenced against the citadel of his purse,
		besides whatever masked batteries may be prepared to take him by
		surprise. It must be our care to be his <i xml:lang="fr">videttes</i>, and keep a
		strict guard upon the motions of the enemy, giving him notice upon
		every approach of danger.
	</p>

	<p>
		Well, I must go and dress: I hate the Opera, but we are forced to
		join a party of Lady Mildmay's, and Lord Clayton will not let us
		be off. <i xml:lang="it">Adio mio Caro.</i> Say something civil to the goodies of the
		Glen. What sickly stuff is pastoral life! I yawn as I write the
		word. Heaven defend me from your Arcadias! I absolutely shudder
		at the notion of a golden age, cool grots, and mountain nymphs.
		That milk diet, too, is a sleepy, corpulent sort of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
															thing. You
		will loose your <i xml:lang="fr">air de noblesse</i>, and we shall have to put you in
		training, and fine you down like a jockey before you are fit to be
		seen.
	</p>

	<p>
		Come quickly. <i xml:lang="fr">Bon repos.</i> <em>You</em> are retiring to your slumbers, no
		doubt.
	</p>

	<p>
		Your mother and Ady said something, I suppose&mdash;loves, and so forth,

	<h3>
		LETTER XI. <br />
		<span class="smcap">General Douglas to Mr. Otway.</span>
	</h3>


	<p class="salut">
		My dear old Friend,
	</p>

	<p class="location">
		Calcutta.
	</p>

	<p>
		Were I less acquainted than I am with what was once Edward Otway, I
		could not dare to address a line with any hope of being remembered
		after the lapse which has occurred since last I wrote to you. I
		almost dread to look back and mark the time; I fear too that I
		should not advance a very satisfactory apology in declaring that I
		have been equally silent to all the European world. I am in this
		dilemma. I will therefore make no effort at defence or explanation,
		but proceed to tell you my present object in applying to you. A
		short time ago I wrote to my old friend Ingoldsby, one of the
		East India Directors to the like effect; but it may be prudent
		to provide against casualties, and therefore be it known to you,
		that with a constitution much shattered through vicissitudes of
		climate, and a mind <em>somewhat</em> jaundiced by disappointment, I am
		turning my face towards
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
								England, which I hope to reach in about
		six months after you receive this announcement of my design. Though
		I speak of disappointment I am not <em>poor</em>; on the contrary I have
		amassed more money than enough to secure all the luxuries, as well
		as comforts of life, for my remaining term; but I have lived in
		banishment from all that ought to have been dear to me; I have lost
		my health, seen little but wickedness in my early intercourse with
		mankind, and, now arrived at a premature old age, I look on the
		past without pleasure, and to the future divested of hope. I have
		for some time been determined to return, but found my pecuniary
		circumstances in much need of winding up; and having learned,
		through sad experience, to distrust the people in whose rectitude
		I had principally confided, I resolved on an arduous undertaking,
		which was no other than to go myself first to Delhi, and thence
		across the country to Bombay, hoping not only to settle my affairs
		in the best manner, but to retrieve my health by change of air
		and scene. The first object I have in a great measure achieved,
		but my liver is deranged, my digestive powers are so impaired
		that I almost
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
					  despair of cure, and my spirits are <em>gone</em>. Here
		is a sorry picture; but to business. If this should find you in
		England, I wish your own taste to be employed, and if you are in
		Ireland, that of any friend on whose judgment you can rely, in
		the purchase of a snug demesne, well wooded, well watered, and
		having a handsome, commodious house, in an airy situation, into
		which I may step as soon as possible after landing. As well as I
		recollect my own impressions, I liked Hampshire, Staffordshire,
		and Warwickshire, better than any other parts of the country,
		and I have no objection to go as far as forty or fifty thousand
		pounds; it must be fee simple property, and in a rich, cultivated
		district. Order whatever furniture you think suitable, and let me
		find a travelling carriage, five or six good horses, and a few
		servants to begin with.&mdash;Dear Otway forgive me if I am giving
		you a great deal of trouble; but Ingoldsby is a fixture in town,
		and I know so little of my relations, that I am hardly aware to
		whom I could give these commissions. The Howards, I conclude, are
		flourishing, for I believe that when my poor brother took the name
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
		he got a pretty estate. Of the Douglas family I have lost
		sight, and as I have long enjoyed the privilege (no small one I
		promise you) of being considered an oddity, I mean to preserve the
		character, and choose for myself amongst the people I may meet
		with. I <em>hate</em> consanguinity. It is a cursed plague to have a set
		of needy folks continually pressing about one, whose claims are
		supported by relationship, and whose cares are generally directed
		by self-interest. I have lived too long, and seen too much to be
		bamboozled, though I do not mean to be uncivil. Poor Henry might
		have made a fortune had he taken my advice, and come out to India
		according to my suggestion; he was my favourite brother, and I
		should have found both pride and pleasure in providing handsomely
		for him; but so absurd a marriage as his naturally alienates a
		prudent man. Poor fellow! I never answered his letters, and looked
		on him as my son; for he was several years my junior, and <em>felt</em>
		his resistance to my advice. I never saw his wife, nor any of
		his children, who have all been born since I came from Europe,
		and though I <em>do</em> feel sorry that he died without any act of
		<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
		reconciliation on my part; though I intend also to settle something
		on his family if they are in want; yet I certainly cannot blame
		myself for having shewn a well merited resentment at conduct so
		highly injurious to himself, and <em>obstinate</em> towards me. It is

		we <em>are</em> here, it is human nature to deplore <em>that</em> folly which
		blights the happiest anticipations in the bud. No man knows the
		value of money so well as he who has made it for himself. If you
		know where poor Mrs. H. Douglas and her family are, I shall thank
		you to let me hear of their retreat, and believe me, my dear Otway,
		with best wishes for a happy meeting,
